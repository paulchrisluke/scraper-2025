A List of All the Ethics Opinions on Cloud Computing for Lawyers

Can law firms use the cloud? With widespread adoption by both consumers and business, and increasing cloud adoption amongst law firms, there is still a section of lawyers that remain skeptical about legal cloud computing, and whether they can use the cloud in their legal practices. 

Bar Associations and Law Societies within the US and around the world have issued ethics opinions on cloud computing for lawyers. The vast majority highlight that lawyers can use cloud computing, provided they do appropriate due diligence and find a provider that complies with a lawyer’s ethical duties. For example, a provider must be able to ensure a reasonable expectation of security so that a law firm is able to keep it’s clients’ information confidential in the cloud.

Below are charts linking each ethic opinion on cloud computing for lawyers. We’ve also included some high-level guidance to help a law firm with research into their jurisdiction’s requirements, based on relevant language from the opinions.

In total, 30 US States have issued formal or informal ethics opinions on cloud use for lawyers, and the American Bar Association has also issued an opinion. Outside of the US, we’re tracking 5 other jurisdictions that have issued ethics opinions on cloud computing for lawyers as well.

Navigating to the Cloud:
A Framework for Trust

If the state or jurisdiction you practice in is featured within this list, make sure any cloud computing providers you use align with the recommendations within your state’s ethics opinion. No matter what, make sure your provider has strong security standards.

If you’re not sure which legal cloud computing tools your firm needs, check out this list of what technology your law firm actually needs. 

If your state or jurisdiction is not on this list, that doesn’t necessarily mean your law firm is prohibited from using the cloud. Make sure you’re following data security best practices, and reach out to your bar association’s ethics committee if you have concerns. I also recommend tuning in to this webinar on tech competence for lawyers put on by myself and Bob Ambrogi.

Today, cloud technology has a wealth of benefits that outweigh any potential risks for law firms, including increased efficiency, lower overhead, and ease of use for their teams. Law firms should feel confident exploring cloud providers, allowing them to benefit from the flexibility and adaptability the cloud provides in a modern environment.
