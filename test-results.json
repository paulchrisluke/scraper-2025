      "content": "Download This Article as a PDF\n\nDeepSeek’s AI Disruption (and Lessons for Legal Professionals)\n\nLast week was a whirlwind for anyone following the latest in tech. Stocks tumbled. Titans like OpenAI and Nvidia found themselves under scrutiny. And across the US, executives, investors, and policymakers scrambled to make sense of a massive disruption. The cause? DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese AI startup that seemingly appeared out of nowhere. \n\nDeepSeek’s sudden rise is a stark reminder of how fast the AI race is accelerating. But beyond the market shock and frenzy it caused, DeepSeek’s story holds valuable lessons—especially for legal professionals navigating this rapidly-evolving landscape.\n\nHave you met Clio Duo? Learn more about Clio’s AI-powered law partner (or book a demo to see it in action)!\n\nUntil recently, DeepSeek wasn’t exactly a household name. The Chinese startup, founded in 2023 by entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng and backed by hedge fund High-Flyer, quietly built a reputation for its cost-effective approach to AI development. It also became known for recruiting young graduates from elite universities across China, offering the chance to work on cutting-edge projects.\n\nDeepSeek shook the industry last week with the release of its new open-source model called DeepSeek-R1, which matches the capabilities of leading chatbots like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. It’s proven to be particularly strong at technical tasks, such as logical reasoning and solving complex mathematical equations.\n\nWhat really turned heads, though, was the fact that DeepSeek achieved this with a fraction of the resources and costs of industry leaders—for example, at just one-thirtieth the price of OpenAI’s flagship product. This was made possible by using fewer advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. The implications of this breakthrough sent shockwaves through the US stock market, erasing some $1 trillion in value.\n\nFor years, AI development has been dominated by deep-pocketed players. Companies like OpenAI and Google invest significantly in powerful chips and data centers, turning the artificial intelligence race into one that centers around who can spend the most. OpenAI and its partners, for instance, have committed at least $100 billion to their Stargate Project. DeepSeek’s ability to sidestep these financial constraints signals a shift in power that could dramatically reshape the AI landscape.\n\nAs DeepSeek came onto the US scene, interest in its technology skyrocketed. Within weeks, its chatbot became the most downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store—eclipsing even ChatGPT. But as it was gaining momentum, it faced an unexpected setback.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, the company revealed it was hit by a large-scale cyberattack, forcing it to temporarily limit new registrations. Existing users could still log in as usual. Soon after, research from cloud security firm Wiz uncovered a major vulnerability—DeepSeek had left one of its databases exposed, compromising over a million records, including system logs, user prompt submissions, and API authentication tokens.\n\nThough the database has since been secured, this incident highlights the potential risks associated with emerging technology.\n\nDeepSeek’s story serves as a reminder that not all AI tools are created equal. While AI innovations are always exciting, security should always be a number one priority—especially for legal professionals handling confidential client information. Rushing to adopt the latest AI tool without assessing its features could put your firm’s data at risk. Before integrating any new tech into your workflows, make sure you thoroughly evaluate its security and data privacy measures.\n\nFor instance, Clio Duo is an AI feature designed specifically with the unique needs of legal professionals in mind. Unlike generic AI tools, it operates within Clio’s trusted environment—ensuring that a firm’s data remains private and isn’t used to train external AI models. On top of that, it includes audit log functionality so users can track and review its activities.\n\nDeepSeek’s rise underscores how quickly the AI landscape is changing. While its breakthroughs are no doubt impressive, the recent cyberattack raises questions about the security of emerging technology. For legal professionals, the takeaway is clear: Choose AI tools built with your industry’s specific needs in mind. The right legal technology will help your firm run more efficiently while keeping your data safe.\n\nReady to explore AI built for legal professionals?

      "title": "Discovery Objections Cheat Sheet",
      "content": "Download This Article as a PDF\n\nDiscovery Objections Cheat Sheet\n\nThe discovery process is a critical element of litigation, and objections to discovery requests are every bit as essential. Any legal professional working in litigation needs to know how to make these objections, and how to respond when the opposing side makes them. Nonetheless, the applicable rules for discovery objections can be confusing.\n\nThis is why a cheat sheet for discovery objections can be valuable.\n\nSimply relying on the recitation of a long list of boilerplate objections will no longer be sufficient. Instead, you will need to provide a specific basis for your objections. If the other side uses objections improperly to avoid providing responses, you need to be able to attack their position to get the information you need.\n\nManaging discovery objections along with administrative tasks can be overwhelming, but Clio Manage streamlines your workload so you can focus on getting discovery done right—book a demo!\n\nObjections have their place in all discovery procedures, including interrogatories, requests for production, requests for admissions, and depositions. Outside the deposition setting, these objections will have to be made in written form.\n\nYou may make a written objection because:\n\nHowever, you want to avoid the appearance of making bad-faith objections in order to withhold evidence harmful to your case. On the other hand, you definitely want to be able to call out your opponent when they use this tactic.\n\nThis is why having a discovery objection cheat sheet is useful. You need a template for the discovery objections you will often use or respond to in any case, while remaining mindful that discovery law will vary between jurisdictions.\n\nDisclaimer: These discovery objections are designed to provide a helpful starting point and to give you a broad understanding of the types of discovery requests you can object to—the information is not exhaustive and not intended as legal advice. And, of course, not all objections will be accepted. It’s critical that you consult with and stay up-to-date on the legal principles relevant to your practice area, jurisdiction, and specific case to ensure you have a solid understanding of how these objections fit within applicable law.\n\nThe following are some of the more common types of discovery objections.\n\nNote: These objections apply to most jurisdictions, and many can also be used in a deposition setting or in court. However, it is important to remember that each state has different discovery rules, as does federal court. Also remember that this list is not exhaustive, only a sampling of common objections.\n\nEvidence is relevant if it has any probative value for a fact that could help determine the outcome of the case. In other words, the evidence must relate to the case and potentially help a trier of fact (whether judge or jury) decide which party will win or lose.\n\nSome jurisdictions, such as California, are somewhat more permissive with the scope of discoverable evidence. These jurisdictions allow discovery into both relevant matters and those matters that appear “reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”\n\nIn federal court, this is not the requirement, as the “reasonably calculated” standard was removed by a 2015 amendment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and replaced with a proportionality standard (discovery must be “proportional to the needs” of the case).\n\nIf a discovery request is overly vague or ambiguous, it may be impossible to respond accurately. When the request is sufficiently vague, you may even object that the request is unintelligible.\n\nMost jurisdictions set limits on the amount of interrogatories and admission requests a party can propound in one case. Compound questions can be used to circumvent these limits by asking more than one question in a single discovery request, making them objectionable.\n\nA discovery request can be unduly burdensome or oppressive if complying with the request would require too much time, energy, and expense for the responding party.\n\nThis objection is most often used with document requests but can apply to other areas of discovery. For example, an interrogatory might be unduly burdensome if it requires the responding party to create a compilation of information.\n\nNote that the burden on the responding party is weighed against the actual need for the discovery and the nature of the case. Even if a request seeks voluminous amounts of records, it might be objectionable in a low-value slip-and-fall case, but not objectionable in a multi-million dollar class action. (The federal proportionality standard, outlined above, can serve as a basis for this objection in federal court cases.)\n\nThe protections for attorney-client communications and attorney work product are similar but different in key respects. While you are not likely to be forced to invoke attorney-client privilege for discovery responses, the work product objection is more common.\n\nAttorney-client privilege serves as ironclad protection for most communications between a lawyer and their client regarding the legal matter at issue.\n\nThere are some limited exceptions in most jurisdictions, such as seeking legal advice to commit a criminal act or using your lawyer’s advice as a legal defense. It is doubtful a party will propound discovery requests seeking privileged attorney-client communications.\n\nAttorney work product protection is a different matter. The work product doctrine protects any documents or tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial. This generally serves as complete protection for anything reflecting an attorney’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories, as is the case in federal court and under California law.\n\nWork product that goes beyond this description generally receives qualified protection, where it will be protected except in extreme cases of unfair prejudice to the party seeking the information.\n\nBoilerplate objections to discovery requests are not likely to survive scrutiny if opposing counsel brings them to the court’s attention. Improve your objections by keeping the following in mind:\n\nA handy cheat sheet for objections to discovery requests can alleviate pressure on legal professionals and allow discovery to proceed smoothly. Nonetheless, remember the cheat sheet is only a starting point. You still need to familiarize yourself with your jurisdiction’s rules relating to allowable discovery and appropriate objections.\n\nIf you also want to streamline the operations of your legal practice, giving you time to focus on discovery issues, look to Clio Manage for help—book your free demo now.\n\nMost discovery questions relate to the responding party’s claims or defenses, as well as any facts, documents, witnesses, or other evidence that party has to support their claims or defenses.\n\nGood objections to discovery requests will be well-grounded in the applicable law and stated clearly enough that they will survive a challenge by the opposing party. This is accomplished with a solid understanding of your jurisdiction’s laws on evidence and civil or criminal procedure.\n\nWhile there is no strict bar on what can be asked in interrogatories, any interrogatory that does not seek relevant evidence, or which seeks privileged information, will be objectionable.\n\nWe published this blog post in January 2025.

      "content": "Download This Article as a PDF\n\nVirtual Reality Steps Into the Courtroom: A Glimpse Into the Future of Justice\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Broward County Circuit Court Judge Andrew Siegel recently used virtual reality (VR) technology during a stand-your-ground hearing. On December 14, 2024, he wore an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset to experience a defense expert’s recreation of the crime scene. The case involved Miguel Albisu, a wedding venue owner charged with aggravated assault. By immersing himself in the VR simulation, the judge was able to view the crime scene from the defendant’s point of view, offering a unique perspective on the incident.\n\nThis moment, a first for  the American legal system, has sparked conversations about the future of legal proceedings and the ethical considerations of embracing such technology.\n\nOur latest Legal Trends Report explores the shifting attitudes toward AI in the legal profession and the opportunities it brings for law firm billing, marketing, and more.\n\nThe introduction of VR in courtrooms, alongside the abundance of AI innovations of recent years, is a transformative approach to presenting evidence. This technology enables judges and jurors to step into a crime scene or incident, offering an immersive understanding that goes well beyond traditional evidence presentation. By stepping into a virtual environment, legal professionals can better understand complex scenarios, potentially leading to more accurate and informed decisions.\n\nBut this innovation doesn’t come without challenges. Questions about how VR might impact the legal process are front and center. Could immersing judges in a virtual scene introduce emotional bias? How can we ensure these recreations are both accurate and fair? Ensuring impartiality alongside innovation will be crucial to making VR a trusted tool in the justice system.\n\nWhile VR holds exciting promise for courtroom applications, it also raises several questions. Ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of virtual recreations will be a major challenge, as courts will need to guarantee that these simulations are reliable and unbiased. This might require bringing in specialists to vet the data, adding both cost and complexity.\n\nCost is another hurdle, with VR setups costing anywhere from several thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, potentially limiting access for smaller courts and underfunded jurisdictions. Moreover, there are significant risks tied to cybersecurity and privacy, as the data driving these simulations could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. And then there’s the human element—experiencing a crime scene virtually could elicit strong emotional reactions, potentially interfering with juror’s ability to remain objective.\n\nVirtual reality has the potential to completely transform how legal professionals manage cases. From virtual crime scene walkthroughs to interactive reconstructions, VR can offer a level of detail and immersion that traditional evidence can’t match. But this shift will require significant changes. Courts must rethink existing processes, establish clear rules for how VR evidence can be used, and invest in proper training for judges, lawyers, and staff. Balancing the benefits of immersive technology with the risks of bias or manipulation will be essential to ensure fairness and accuracy in legal proceedings.\n\nAs courtroom technology evolves, legal professionals need tools that can keep up.

      "content": "Download This Article as a PDF\n\nHow AI Legal Document Review Drives Faster Case Prep\n\nReviewing legal documents is undeniably tedious.\n\nHowever, while it may be time-consuming, legal document review is also essential for building a strong case strategy and effectively preparing for trial. And, because even the most tenured lawyer can make mistakes or miss important details, it has to be effective and thorough.\n\nIn this post, we’ll examine everything you need to know about AI for legal document review—from the basics of AI technology to best practices for implementing it responsibly and effectively at your firm.\n\nWant to use AI to save time, accelerate your casework, and find more time for strategic work? Clio Duo, your legal AI partner built into Clio Manage, automates routine tasks, prioritizes your day, and helps you work smarter. Learn more here.\n\nAI for legal document review uses artificial intelligence to quickly analyze, sort, and identify key information from legal documents. It streamlines the review process and allows for improved accuracy by using AI to automatically take care of the most time-consuming review work.\n\nAI for legal document review can automate legal document review, enhance your eDiscovery process, quickly find relevant case law or legal opinions, analyze vast legal databases in minutes, and more—ultimately saving you time while helping you build a substantial, well-supported case.\n\nWhile there are many different tools available to facilitate the process, AI for legal document review typically uses AI technologies to identify patterns and relationships between documents and categorize documents. These may include:\n\nThere are two primary types of AI for legal document review: technology assisted review (TAR) and generative AI.\n\nTechnology assisted review is currently the most widely-used subset of tools for AI for legal document review. It’s used to review and categorize documents, particularly in the eDiscovery process, where many courts accept TAR. TAR uses software and machine learning to help lawyers review, analyze, and prioritize large quantities of documents to save lawyers time.\n\nFor example, when using TAR, a lawyer may tag documents in a sample set as relevant or not relevant. Learning from these examples provided by the human input, the TAR program will predict the relevance of the remaining documents in the set.\n\nWhile TAR can help legal professionals speed up the process of document review—which can, in turn, reduce the cost and time spent on manual review—it does have limitations.\n\nFor one, the strength and effectiveness of TAR’s output depends on the quality of the initial training set. For another, TAR is focused primarily on structured text-heavy documents for review, like emails or Word documents. This means it can’t accommodate other common types and mediums of data that need to be reviewed, such as videos.\n\nWhile the technology is still emerging, legal teams are increasingly adopting generative AI tools—which can generate content like text and images based on certain prompts or inputs—to assist with document review.\n\nGenerative AI can do more than categorize and prioritize text-based documents: Generative AI tools can process, analyze, and review many different types of data, such as documents, text messages, and social media posts. It can also generate summaries, assist with document drafting, and offer a more in-depth interpretation of content.\n\nStill, generative AI also has its limitations for legal document review. As a newer, developing technology, it’s less widely accepted in courts than TAR tools. Generative AI is also prone to AI hallucinations, which can lead to plausible but inaccurate or unsupported outputs, making human oversight essential when using it in legal contexts.\n\nThe best choice for AI for legal document analysis depends on your firm’s specific needs, including the type of documents you typically review, the volume of your work, and your preferred workflows. Whether you’re looking for generated content like document summaries, data organization, or other types of document analysis, you’ll likely want to focus on AI tools that use machine learning and have generative AI capabilities.\n\nSome examples of tools for AI for legal document review include:\n\nCase prep takes time, but AI can assist with some of its most labor-intensive parts by streamlining legal document review and analyzing large volumes of documents with speed and precision. This frees up more time to focus on creating a winning case for your clients.\n\nUsing AI makes it easier and faster to sift through documents to\n\nAI offers plenty of big benefits for streamlining legal document review, but—as with any AI solution for lawyers—it also comes with unique risks and ethical considerations.\n\nBefore leveraging AI technology for legal document review, it’s essential to be up-to-date on the relevant ethical issues (our post on ethical considerations in law is a good place to start). And, if your firm doesn’t have a structured AI policy, create one—this guide to creating a law firm AI policy can help.\n\nYou’ll also want to consider the following best practices for using AI for legal document review:\n\nIf you’re ready to implement an AI solution to help with legal document review, it’s important to vet your options carefully. In addition to evaluating potential tools for their security, cost, and customer reviews, you’ll want to consider the following:\n\nRest assured, AI is not coming for legal professionals’ jobs: AI assists with rather than replaces human legal work.\n\nIn fact, not embracing the potential of AI technology may leave you at risk of being left behind by your competition. As the latest Legal Trends Report found, the vast majority of lawyers use AI, with 79% of lawyers adopting AI in some capacity.\n\nTools related to legal document review are among the most commonly adopted by legal professionals, with document drafting (18%), eDiscovery (12%), and contract review (11%) ranking among the top AI solutions being adopted by the legal industry, according to the Legal Trends Report.\n\nAI is shifting the structure of legal work by using AI technology to automate mundane tasks and handle large document volumes with document review. This enables lawyers to focus on higher-value and strategic work. Over time, this shift improves efficiency, productivity, and client outcomes.\n\nAI has the power to transform legal document review by automating monotonous processes and extracting valuable insights from vast data sets. Rather than spending hours poring over emails, contracts, or discovery documents, you can focus on strategy and client advocacy. The result? Faster case prep, reduced costs, and improved outcomes.\n\nReady to simplify your document workflow?\n\nClio Draft can help you automate legal document creation and expedite the signing process—saving hours and boosting your firm’s productivity.\n\nAI can analyze legal documents in several ways. Certain AI tools can quickly and efficiently review, categorize, and pull key information from large quantities of legal documents like case files and discovery documents. This analysis may include summarizing content, flagging inconsistencies or potential risks, or identifying relevant details.\n\nMany AI tools are designed to create drafts of legal documents like contracts and pleadings. These tools typically analyze existing data and use natural language processing and machine learning to quickly create initial drafts, which legal professionals can then review and revise.\n\nWe published this blog post in January 2025.

The best legal blogging platform depends on your goals, what you want to achieve, how much time and money you’re willing to invest, and your technical comfort level.\n\nNeed some blogging inspiration? Check out our list of Best Legal Blogs for Attorneys in 2025.\n\nWhen people have legal questions, their first stop is often Google (or another search engine). They’re looking for clear answers they can understand, and Google gives them results. This is where your blog can shine. By offering helpful, well-written and informative content, you’re not only providing real value to potential clients, you’re connecting with them.\n\nProviding value for clients is crucial, but there are other ways blogging is important for lawyers.\n\nHere are a few things that blogging helps you with:\n\nA blog is a great platform to demonstrate your knowledge in your practice area. Not only can you answer questions from potential clients, you can also share your insights and perspectives on legal issues. This enables you to build trust with your clients and highlight your expertise.\n\nWhen your content is helpful and informative, people are more likely to view you as the solution they need to help them with their legal problems.\n\nBlogs work both by drawing visitors to your website and establishing your credibility. When people search for high-level legal information and come across your website, you have the opportunity to convert them into leads and then clients, an opportunity you wouldn’t have had without your blog. Additionally, it gives referrals a place to confirm what they’ve heard about you before they reach out.\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is crucial in establishing your website’s visibility in search engine rankings. Your blog gives you a place to target the keywords your potential clients are searching for, and the more opportunities you have to do this, the better your website will rank. That way, when people search for “family law attorney” in their city, your website is more likely to be among the first they come across.\n\nThought leadership is a great way to attract clients. By regularly publishing researched and informative content, you can demonstrate your authority. This will attract potential clients and referrals to your site. If you publish on topics relevant to the media, you may wind up with opportunities where journalists position you as an expert or interview source based on your blog posts. This can expose you to an even broader audience.\n\nYour blog is a site to build your authority, share your personality, and highlight your approach to the law. These are all elements that differentiate you from other lawyers and law firms, and it enables clients to get a feel for you. When clients feel they know, like, and trust you, they’re more likely to work with you.\n\nUsing your blog as an educational resource helps clients understand complex issues, which can result in a smoother attorney-client relationship. It also enables you to efficiently answer frequently asked questions, and provides you with a resource you can send clients to for more information.\n\nGoogle prefers websites that are updated regularly, so if you aren’t consistently adding new content to your website and updating the existing content, Google will likely view it as outdated. Blogging regularly is a great way to add fresh content to your website. You can also use it for internal linking and backlinking, further enhancing your site’s credibility.\n\nIf you’re searching for things to post about on social media, a blog provides you with content to keep your social media active, giving you even more opportunities to bring people to your website.\n\nRead more about how to start a legal blog.\n\nThe best length for an attorney blog depends on your goals, audience, and the complexity of your topic. Short blogs are best for quick answers to questions, medium blogs allow for some in-depth analysis, and longer blogs let you build thought leadership.\n\nThere’s a lot to consider when it comes to your ideal legal blogging platform. Among the factors to consider are:\n\nThe best platform for your legal blog depends on your needs, your audience, and your budget.  With so many options out there, it’s all about finding the one that fits your goals. Whether you’re looking to showcase your expertise, grow your online presence, establish thought leadership, or connect with clients, there’s a platform that can help you achieve it.\n\nWith Clio Grow you can streamline your client intake process, create custom workflows and email automations, and enjoy seamless website hosting, all without needing design or coding skills. It’s everything you need to build a professional, efficient law firm website in one easy-to-use platform.

However, the distinction between hard costs and soft costs can often lead to confusion. This understanding is crucial for legal professionals to gain a comprehensive view of the firm’s financial operations and ensure its sustainability for long-term success.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the nuances of these cost categories—empowering you to make informed decisions, develop sound financial planning strategies, and ultimately improve your firm’s bottom line.\nTypes of Law Firm Expenses\n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27613 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1.png 1200w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />\nLaw firm expenses can be broadly categorized into two main groups: hard costs and soft costs.\nLet’s explore how these two law firm expenses differ.\nHard Costs\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27616 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nHard costs are expenses that are paid upfront and directly to a third-party vendor for services rendered on behalf of a client matter. These costs are associated with tangible expenses necessary for legal service delivery, such as:\n\nCourt filing fees\nExpert witness fees\nDeposition fees\nLaboratory fees\n\nHard costs are typically viewed as necessary expenses by clients and are, therefore, more readily reimbursed.\nAccurate and detailed recording of hard costs is essential for effective financial management and billing, but it can be a time-consuming endeavor. Fortunately, there are ways to streamline and automate the process—legal billing software that includes expense tracking functionality, such as MyCase Smart Spend, allows you to categorize all law firm expenses, enabling you to map each cost in real time. This is the first spend management software designed for the unique needs of law firms. \nSoft Costs\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27615 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nSoft costs, on the other hand, are expenses that do not result in a direct payment to a third-party vendor. These costs typically revolve around resources used in legal practice, such as:\n\nLegal research costs\nMileage expenses\nPhotocopying expenses\nPostage fees\nTelephone charges\n\nThey can also include the following overhead expenses:\n\nOffice rent and utilities\nEmployee salaries and benefits\nTechnology and software\nAdministrative support\nInsurance\n\nAlthough soft costs are billable to clients, there can be more resistance to paying for this type of cost. Clients may argue that law firms should absorb these costs as necessary expenses of doing business. It’s up to your firm to effectively manage soft costs and communicate billing processes to clients.\nLegal billing software with built-in expense management tools can aid in this process. With MyCase Smart Spend, it’s easy to link expenses to client cases—even for lawyers on the go. You can upload a picture of the receipt, add a description, and automatically add the reimbursable expense to a client’s invoice.\nWhy Your Firm Needs a Spend Management Strategy\nDeveloping and implementing a spend management strategy is crucial for the long-term success of your law firm. Without it, your firm may face challenges related to financial mismanagement, overspending, and reduced profitability.\nHere are three main benefits of law firm spend management:\n1. Greater Peace of Mind\nBy closely monitoring and controlling your law firm’s budget and expenses, you can gain a deeper understanding of your overall financial health, identify areas for improvement, and make more informed decisions. This level of financial clarity can provide you and your team with a greater sense of confidence and security, allowing you to focus on delivering exceptional legal services to your clients.\n2. Increased Law Firm Profitability\nEffective expense management can have a direct impact on your firm’s bottom line. By identifying and reducing unnecessary or excessive spending, you can optimize your firm’s financial resources and reinvest in areas that drive growth and profitability. This may include talent acquisition, technology upgrades, or strategic marketing initiatives.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-300x43.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-1024x147.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-768x110.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nIt’s also important to remember that managing law firm finances is not simply about cutting costs; it’s about strategically allocating resources to maximize the return on investment (ROI). This approach ensures optimal resource utilization, driving cost savings and sustainable revenue growth.\n3. Reduced Financial Risk\nProactive expense management can help your law firm mitigate financial risks, such as unexpected cost overruns, cash flow disruptions, or budget shortfalls. By having a clear understanding of your firm’s expenses and implementing effective cost-control measures, you can better prepare for and navigate any financial challenges that may arise.\nHow to Manage Law Firm Expenses\nTo effectively manage your law firm’s expenses, consider implementing the following strategies:\n1. Reduce Office Rent Costs\nCarefully evaluate your firm’s office space needs and consider options to reduce rent expenses. Start by assessing the use of your current space and determine if downsizing is a feasible option. You can also contact your landlord to explore lease renegotiations or potential rent reductions. Additionally, consider remote or hybrid work arrangements for your team. This approach reduces the need for extensive office space while maintaining productivity and providing an employee perk.\n2. Invest in Efficient Marketing Channels\nAnalyze the ROI of your firm’s marketing efforts and focus your resources on the most effective and cost-efficient channels. \nDigital marketing is often the most effective and cost-friendly approach. Consider allocating your marketing budget toward search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and social media campaigns. You can also run targeted ad campaigns, which allow you to focus on specific demographics and interests. \nFinally, attend networking events where you can generate leads or referrals from other legal professionals. \n3. Brainstorm and Budget Firm Expenses\nRegularly review and update your law firm’s budget, taking into account both hard costs and soft costs. Foster a culture of financial awareness and encourage your team to contribute ideas for expense reduction or optimization. You can achieve this by holding regular meetings to discuss cost-saving initiatives and explore solutions. \nBy involving your entire team in the law firm budgeting process, you can gain valuable insights and ideas that lead to expense reductions without compromising the quality of your services.\n4. Use Legal Expense Management Software\nLeverage a spend management solution, like MyCase Smart Spend, to streamline your law firm’s financial planning and expense management.

However, the distinction between hard costs and soft costs can often lead to confusion. This understanding is crucial for legal professionals to gain a comprehensive view of the firm’s financial operations and ensure its sustainability for long-term success.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the nuances of these cost categories—empowering you to make informed decisions, develop sound financial planning strategies, and ultimately improve your firm’s bottom line.\nTypes of Law Firm Expenses\n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27613 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1.png 1200w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_BodyImage-1200x900-1-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />\nLaw firm expenses can be broadly categorized into two main groups: hard costs and soft costs.\nLet’s explore how these two law firm expenses differ.\nHard Costs\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27616 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-1-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nHard costs are expenses that are paid upfront and directly to a third-party vendor for services rendered on behalf of a client matter. These costs are associated with tangible expenses necessary for legal service delivery, such as:\n\nCourt filing fees\nExpert witness fees\nDeposition fees\nLaboratory fees\n\nHard costs are typically viewed as necessary expenses by clients and are, therefore, more readily reimbursed.\nAccurate and detailed recording of hard costs is essential for effective financial management and billing, but it can be a time-consuming endeavor. Fortunately, there are ways to streamline and automate the process—legal billing software that includes expense tracking functionality, such as MyCase Smart Spend, allows you to categorize all law firm expenses, enabling you to map each cost in real time. This is the first spend management software designed for the unique needs of law firms. \nSoft Costs\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27615 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-2-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nSoft costs, on the other hand, are expenses that do not result in a direct payment to a third-party vendor. These costs typically revolve around resources used in legal practice, such as:\n\nLegal research costs\nMileage expenses\nPhotocopying expenses\nPostage fees\nTelephone charges\n\nThey can also include the following overhead expenses:\n\nOffice rent and utilities\nEmployee salaries and benefits\nTechnology and software\nAdministrative support\nInsurance\n\nAlthough soft costs are billable to clients, there can be more resistance to paying for this type of cost. Clients may argue that law firms should absorb these costs as necessary expenses of doing business. It’s up to your firm to effectively manage soft costs and communicate billing processes to clients.\nLegal billing software with built-in expense management tools can aid in this process. With MyCase Smart Spend, it’s easy to link expenses to client cases—even for lawyers on the go. You can upload a picture of the receipt, add a description, and automatically add the reimbursable expense to a client’s invoice.\nWhy Your Firm Needs a Spend Management Strategy\nDeveloping and implementing a spend management strategy is crucial for the long-term success of your law firm. Without it, your firm may face challenges related to financial mismanagement, overspending, and reduced profitability.\nHere are three main benefits of law firm spend management:\n1. Greater Peace of Mind\nBy closely monitoring and controlling your law firm’s budget and expenses, you can gain a deeper understanding of your overall financial health, identify areas for improvement, and make more informed decisions. This level of financial clarity can provide you and your team with a greater sense of confidence and security, allowing you to focus on delivering exceptional legal services to your clients.\n2. Increased Law Firm Profitability\nEffective expense management can have a direct impact on your firm’s bottom line. By identifying and reducing unnecessary or excessive spending, you can optimize your firm’s financial resources and reinvest in areas that drive growth and profitability. This may include talent acquisition, technology upgrades, or strategic marketing initiatives.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-300x43.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-1024x147.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MC-Blog-Understanding-Expenses_Pull-Quote-3-768x110.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nIt’s also important to remember that managing law firm finances is not simply about cutting costs; it’s about strategically allocating resources to maximize the return on investment (ROI). This approach ensures optimal resource utilization, driving cost savings and sustainable revenue growth.\n3. Reduced Financial Risk\nProactive expense management can help your law firm mitigate financial risks, such as unexpected cost overruns, cash flow disruptions, or budget shortfalls. By having a clear understanding of your firm’s expenses and implementing effective cost-control measures, you can better prepare for and navigate any financial challenges that may arise.\nHow to Manage Law Firm Expenses\nTo effectively manage your law firm’s expenses, consider implementing the following strategies:\n1. Reduce Office Rent Costs\nCarefully evaluate your firm’s office space needs and consider options to reduce rent expenses. Start by assessing the use of your current space and determine if downsizing is a feasible option. You can also contact your landlord to explore lease renegotiations or potential rent reductions. Additionally, consider remote or hybrid work arrangements for your team. This approach reduces the need for extensive office space while maintaining productivity and providing an employee perk.\n2. Invest in Efficient Marketing Channels\nAnalyze the ROI of your firm’s marketing efforts and focus your resources on the most effective and cost-efficient channels. \nDigital marketing is often the most effective and cost-friendly approach. Consider allocating your marketing budget toward search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and social media campaigns. You can also run targeted ad campaigns, which allow you to focus on specific demographics and interests. \nFinally, attend networking events where you can generate leads or referrals from other legal professionals. \n3. Brainstorm and Budget Firm Expenses\nRegularly review and update your law firm’s budget, taking into account both hard costs and soft costs. Foster a culture of financial awareness and encourage your team to contribute ideas for expense reduction or optimization. You can achieve this by holding regular meetings to discuss cost-saving initiatives and explore solutions. \nBy involving your entire team in the law firm budgeting process, you can gain valuable insights and ideas that lead to expense reductions without compromising the quality of your services.\n4. Use Legal Expense Management Software\nLeverage a spend management solution, like MyCase Smart Spend, to streamline your law firm’s financial planning and expense management. This tool (the first spend management solution of its kind for law firms) can automate expense tracking, reporting, and budgeting processes, saving significant time and effort.

Many lawyers would say their time-consuming billing and invoicing processes. After all, most would rather spend time helping clients than completing administrative tasks. \nFortunately, your firm can speed up invoicing using an attorney billing statement—a customizable invoice template. In this guide, we’ll cover the following topics. \n\nHow to establish an efficient pre-billing process that positions your firm for success  \nFeatures that every attorney invoice should contain  \nA sample attorney billing statement (and how to use it)\nAttorney billing best practices that can help improve cash flow  \n\nHow to Prepare for Invoicing and Billing \nCrafting a profitable invoicing and billing system for your law firm starts long before sending a client invoice. Below are a few strategies that can set you up for success. \n1. Set Your Fees \nPricing is at the core of law firm profitability, but it can be tough to know what to charge. \nSet your fees too low, and you’ll struggle to drive a profit. Set your fees too high, and prospects may choose your lower-priced competition. Additionally, lawyers are required to charge “reasonable” fees, as the American Bar Association explains. \nThat’s why benchmarking is so important. If you want to know where you stand in the pack, check out our interactive hourly rate tool. It offers average hourly rates for lawyers by practice area and geographic location based on anonymized data from MyCase legal practice management software. \n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23328\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-22-at-2.22.13-PM.png\" alt=\"Learn where you should set your fees. Check out the MyCase interactive hourly rate tool on our website.\" width=\"2658\" height=\"696\" />\n\n2. Proactively Communicate With Clients\nWhen building positive client relationships, communication is a make-or-break factor. Explain your scope of services and essential invoicing and billing details from the start, so everyone’s on the same page. You’ll also want to touch on the following topics in your attorney-client contracts and the onboarding process. \n\nFees (broken down by attorney or practice area, if necessary) \nAttorney invoice schedules (e.g., monthly or upon reaching certain milestones) \nPayment terms, such as how quickly they’ll need to pay \nAvailable payment methods, such as credit cards and ACH \n\nThis can ensure that clients don’t receive any unpleasant surprises that negatively impact their experience with your firm. Proactive communication may also help your law firm get paid more often and faster. \nTip: Read our attorney-client interview guide to discover what else you should cover in your consultations, in addition to fees and billing. \n3. Capture Every Minute \nThe most accurate attorney invoices track every minute. Using a standardized legal time-tracking template can help you get started. However, a comprehensive time-tracking solution can help expedite the process. With MyCase time-tracking software, for example, you can start and stop up to three timers. With this feature, you can capture and log all billable hours according to your billable hours chart as you switch between matters. If you forget to start a timer, our software will alert you to track time when you complete a task, such as sending an email. \nYou can also take advantage of the MyCase Smart Time Finder. This built-in system identifies overlooked actions and allows you to create associated time entries quickly. Lawyers who leveraged Smart Time Finder in 2021 billed an extra 25 hours on average, or $8,600 in additional revenue (as explained in our Benchmark Report, Part 1: How Work Gets Done in Law Firms).\nOnce you’ve logged time with MyCase time-tracking software, instantly convert entries into invoices and easily send out bills. This eliminates redundant administrative work and helps you get bills out on time. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23329\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-22-at-2.53.16-PM.png\" alt=\"Smart Time Finder will help you capture every billable minute.

However, every legal billing template should contain a few key elements to simplify your accounting procedures and read as a client-friendly document. Learn more about elements to include below or check out our collection of legal invoicing templates for more examples.\n\nDetails of Your Law Firm and Client \nA billing form should list the bill recipient and sender. For a legal billing template, this may mean your law firm’s and the client’s:\n\nName\nAddress \nPhone number\nEmail address\n\nThe Date \nAn attorney invoice should include the date of issue—the day the invoice goes out to the client.\nItemized List of Services and Associated Costs\nOften the most time-consuming part of an invoice, an itemized list of services breaks down the invoice total into sub-tasks and their associated costs. This serves multiple purposes. \n\nPromoting transparency around fees, so clients understand where their money is going. This helps prevent sticker shock and can help you proactively address concerns. \nAllowing clients to ask questions about specific services and rates\nIncreasing accountability around billing. If lawyers must list all line items, they’re less likely to pad bills. \nEnsuring bill accuracy (which can be facilitated by automated time tracking)\n\nWhen creating an itemized list of services, briefly describe the services provided. For example, your firm may have “prepared documents for a client meeting.” Then, include the amount of time spent on each service. Lawyers billing by the hour typically track time in six-minute increments. \nIf it took 24 minutes to prepare client documents, for instance, you would log 0.4 hours for that line item. Finally, include the billing rate for each service. This could be an hourly rate or a flat fee. \nExpenses\nInclude any applicable expenses on your bill template, such as filing costs or court fees. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23332\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iStock-941906652-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"An itemized attorney billing statement should include a description of services, expenses, subtotals, and more. Automatically generate itemized invoices (based on time entries) using MyCase.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" />\n\nTotals, Subtotals, and Taxes\nOnce you have itemized services, calculating totals and subtotals should be easy. In fact, many invoicing programs do these calculations automatically. \nTo calculate a total for each service, simply multiply the time spent on the task by the service rate. For example, if you spent 0.4 hours preparing client documents and your hourly rate was $250, the total owed for that service is $100. \nAfter determining the total for each service, combine all totals to get the invoice subtotal. Don’t forget to incorporate the appropriate percentage of service tax for your state on the billing form—you can list the tax rate and the total tax amount in dollars. Add the subtotal and tax amount to reach the final invoice balance. \nStatement Due Date and Penalty Late Fees\nThe statement due date is important, as it tells clients when they need to pay the invoice. You can also list a breakdown of late fees if they don’t fulfill the bill on time. Late fees can be associated with a percentage of the invoice amount or a flat fee per day (up to a cap). \nCheck with your state bar association before implementing late fees on your bill template. Some state regulations may restrict the amount you can charge every year. \nPayment Methods \nExplain how clients can fulfill payments. If you accept checks, provide the recipient’s name and mailing address. \nYou should also discuss payment methods with clients at the start of every matter and include details in your attorney-client agreement. Clients shouldn’t receive this information for the first time on the billing form. This can create an overall negative experience. \nTrust Account Balance and Details \nDoes your firm manage client trust accounts? An attorney invoice is a great way to update clients about their trust account balance. You can even feature a list of trust account transactions (debits and credits) to keep your team and clients on the same page. \nSample Attorney Billing Statement\nNow, let’s combine all of these pieces into one bill template. Check out the sample attorney billing statement below, created in minutes using MyCase legal invoicing software. Then, learn how to use the template to create your own invoices. \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23331\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-12.49.32-PM.png\" alt=\"Generate invoices, like this sample attorney billing statement, in minutes with MyCase.

With MyCase, your firm can develop customized invoices and easily send bills to every client. Use time-tracking entries or flat fees to generate invoices. Then, choose what information to include, such as the following.  \n\nAttorneys and staff who worked on the case, their billable tasks, and their billable rates\nPayment terms (e.g., net 30, net 15, or due upon receipt)\nPayment methods \nLate fee amount (you can also decide whether to automatically apply late fees if the invoice is overdue)\n\nAfterward, you’ll see when a client views or takes action on an invoice. MyCase also allows you to automate invoice reminders.\nAttorney Billing Best Practices\nUsing law firm billing and invoicing software to create a customizable bill template can help free up time. To further improve your process and increase collections, try these four attorney billing best practices. \n1. Offer Multiple Payment Options \nIf you allow clients to pay by their preferred method (paper check, eCheck, or credit card), your firm is more likely to collect. Fortunately, accepting electronic payments doesn’t have to be complicated. LawPay, the industry leader in legal payments, integrates seamlessly with MyCase to streamline your billing and invoicing system. \n2. Try Payment Plans \nDo many of your clients struggle to fulfill their bills? Consider offering payment plans, which break fees into installments. This can be more affordable for clients and ensure a more consistent cash flow for your firm. \n3. Look at the Landscape \nStay informed about your firm’s finances with MyCase financial analytics. For instance, you can use the “Trust Account” reports to track trust account balances and ensure compliance with state laws. Or, use the “Aging Invoices” report to see all outstanding balances owed to the firm. \nWith financial data and case analytics, you’ll stay well-informed about your firm’s current and projected finances. \n4. Be Consistent and Clear \nIn billing, predictability is the name of the game. Send your invoices and reminders regularly, so clients know when to expect them and can budget accordingly. A consistent billing schedule also helps facilitate punctual attorney time-tracking and makes cash flow more predictable. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23333\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iStock-1371880438-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Creating and managing attorney billing statements doesn't have to be complicated.

Many lawyers would say their time-consuming billing and invoicing processes. After all, most would rather spend time helping clients than completing administrative tasks. \nFortunately, your firm can speed up invoicing using an attorney billing statement—a customizable invoice template. In this guide, we’ll cover the following topics. \n\nHow to establish an efficient pre-billing process that positions your firm for success  \nFeatures that every attorney invoice should contain  \nA sample attorney billing statement (and how to use it)\nAttorney billing best practices that can help improve cash flow  \n\nHow to Prepare for Invoicing and Billing \nCrafting a profitable invoicing and billing system for your law firm starts long before sending a client invoice. Below are a few strategies that can set you up for success. \n1. Set Your Fees \nPricing is at the core of law firm profitability, but it can be tough to know what to charge. \nSet your fees too low, and you’ll struggle to drive a profit. Set your fees too high, and prospects may choose your lower-priced competition. Additionally, lawyers are required to charge “reasonable” fees, as the American Bar Association explains. \nThat’s why benchmarking is so important. If you want to know where you stand in the pack, check out our interactive hourly rate tool. It offers average hourly rates for lawyers by practice area and geographic location based on anonymized data from MyCase legal practice management software. \n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23328\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-22-at-2.22.13-PM.png\" alt=\"Learn where you should set your fees. Check out the MyCase interactive hourly rate tool on our website.\" width=\"2658\" height=\"696\" />\n\n2. Proactively Communicate With Clients\nWhen building positive client relationships, communication is a make-or-break factor. Explain your scope of services and essential invoicing and billing details from the start, so everyone’s on the same page. You’ll also want to touch on the following topics in your attorney-client contracts and the onboarding process. \n\nFees (broken down by attorney or practice area, if necessary) \nAttorney invoice schedules (e.g., monthly or upon reaching certain milestones) \nPayment terms, such as how quickly they’ll need to pay \nAvailable payment methods, such as credit cards and ACH \n\nThis can ensure that clients don’t receive any unpleasant surprises that negatively impact their experience with your firm. Proactive communication may also help your law firm get paid more often and faster. \nTip: Read our attorney-client interview guide to discover what else you should cover in your consultations, in addition to fees and billing. \n3. Capture Every Minute \nThe most accurate attorney invoices track every minute. Using a standardized legal time-tracking template can help you get started. However, a comprehensive time-tracking solution can help expedite the process. With MyCase time-tracking software, for example, you can start and stop up to three timers. With this feature, you can capture and log all billable hours according to your billable hours chart as you switch between matters. If you forget to start a timer, our software will alert you to track time when you complete a task, such as sending an email. \nYou can also take advantage of the MyCase Smart Time Finder. This built-in system identifies overlooked actions and allows you to create associated time entries quickly. Lawyers who leveraged Smart Time Finder in 2021 billed an extra 25 hours on average, or $8,600 in additional revenue (as explained in our Benchmark Report, Part 1: How Work Gets Done in Law Firms).\nOnce you’ve logged time with MyCase time-tracking software, instantly convert entries into invoices and easily send out bills. This eliminates redundant administrative work and helps you get bills out on time. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23329\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-22-at-2.53.16-PM.png\" alt=\"Smart Time Finder will help you capture every billable minute.

However, every legal billing template should contain a few key elements to simplify your accounting procedures and read as a client-friendly document. Learn more about elements to include below or check out our collection of legal invoicing templates for more examples.\n\nDetails of Your Law Firm and Client \nA billing form should list the bill recipient and sender. For a legal billing template, this may mean your law firm’s and the client’s:\n\nName\nAddress \nPhone number\nEmail address\n\nThe Date \nAn attorney invoice should include the date of issue—the day the invoice goes out to the client.\nItemized List of Services and Associated Costs\nOften the most time-consuming part of an invoice, an itemized list of services breaks down the invoice total into sub-tasks and their associated costs. This serves multiple purposes. \n\nPromoting transparency around fees, so clients understand where their money is going. This helps prevent sticker shock and can help you proactively address concerns. \nAllowing clients to ask questions about specific services and rates\nIncreasing accountability around billing. If lawyers must list all line items, they’re less likely to pad bills. \nEnsuring bill accuracy (which can be facilitated by automated time tracking)\n\nWhen creating an itemized list of services, briefly describe the services provided. For example, your firm may have “prepared documents for a client meeting.” Then, include the amount of time spent on each service. Lawyers billing by the hour typically track time in six-minute increments. \nIf it took 24 minutes to prepare client documents, for instance, you would log 0.4 hours for that line item. Finally, include the billing rate for each service. This could be an hourly rate or a flat fee. \nExpenses\nInclude any applicable expenses on your bill template, such as filing costs or court fees. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23332\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iStock-941906652-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"An itemized attorney billing statement should include a description of services, expenses, subtotals, and more. Automatically generate itemized invoices (based on time entries) using MyCase.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" />\n\nTotals, Subtotals, and Taxes\nOnce you have itemized services, calculating totals and subtotals should be easy. In fact, many invoicing programs do these calculations automatically. \nTo calculate a total for each service, simply multiply the time spent on the task by the service rate. For example, if you spent 0.4 hours preparing client documents and your hourly rate was $250, the total owed for that service is $100. \nAfter determining the total for each service, combine all totals to get the invoice subtotal. Don’t forget to incorporate the appropriate percentage of service tax for your state on the billing form—you can list the tax rate and the total tax amount in dollars. Add the subtotal and tax amount to reach the final invoice balance. \nStatement Due Date and Penalty Late Fees\nThe statement due date is important, as it tells clients when they need to pay the invoice. You can also list a breakdown of late fees if they don’t fulfill the bill on time. Late fees can be associated with a percentage of the invoice amount or a flat fee per day (up to a cap). \nCheck with your state bar association before implementing late fees on your bill template. Some state regulations may restrict the amount you can charge every year. \nPayment Methods \nExplain how clients can fulfill payments. If you accept checks, provide the recipient’s name and mailing address. \nYou should also discuss payment methods with clients at the start of every matter and include details in your attorney-client agreement. Clients shouldn’t receive this information for the first time on the billing form. This can create an overall negative experience. \nTrust Account Balance and Details \nDoes your firm manage client trust accounts? An attorney invoice is a great way to update clients about their trust account balance. You can even feature a list of trust account transactions (debits and credits) to keep your team and clients on the same page. \nSample Attorney Billing Statement\nNow, let’s combine all of these pieces into one bill template. Check out the sample attorney billing statement below, created in minutes using MyCase legal invoicing software. Then, learn how to use the template to create your own invoices. \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23331\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-12.49.32-PM.png\" alt=\"Generate invoices, like this sample attorney billing statement, in minutes with MyCase.

With MyCase, your firm can develop customized invoices and easily send bills to every client. Use time-tracking entries or flat fees to generate invoices. Then, choose what information to include, such as the following.  \n\nAttorneys and staff who worked on the case, their billable tasks, and their billable rates\nPayment terms (e.g., net 30, net 15, or due upon receipt)\nPayment methods \nLate fee amount (you can also decide whether to automatically apply late fees if the invoice is overdue)\n\nAfterward, you’ll see when a client views or takes action on an invoice. MyCase also allows you to automate invoice reminders.\nAttorney Billing Best Practices\nUsing law firm billing and invoicing software to create a customizable bill template can help free up time. To further improve your process and increase collections, try these four attorney billing best practices. \n1. Offer Multiple Payment Options \nIf you allow clients to pay by their preferred method (paper check, eCheck, or credit card), your firm is more likely to collect. Fortunately, accepting electronic payments doesn’t have to be complicated. LawPay, the industry leader in legal payments, integrates seamlessly with MyCase to streamline your billing and invoicing system. \n2. Try Payment Plans \nDo many of your clients struggle to fulfill their bills? Consider offering payment plans, which break fees into installments. This can be more affordable for clients and ensure a more consistent cash flow for your firm. \n3. Look at the Landscape \nStay informed about your firm’s finances with MyCase financial analytics. For instance, you can use the “Trust Account” reports to track trust account balances and ensure compliance with state laws. Or, use the “Aging Invoices” report to see all outstanding balances owed to the firm. \nWith financial data and case analytics, you’ll stay well-informed about your firm’s current and projected finances. \n4. Be Consistent and Clear \nIn billing, predictability is the name of the game. Send your invoices and reminders regularly, so clients know when to expect them and can budget accordingly. A consistent billing schedule also helps facilitate punctual attorney time-tracking and makes cash flow more predictable. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23333\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iStock-1371880438-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Creating and managing attorney billing statements doesn't have to be complicated.

These rates vary depending on the practice area and geographic location. For instance, attorneys who are well-known in a certain area of the law may charge more hourly lawyer prices than those who aren’t. An attorney hourly rate may also differ based on what the case entails and how much time the lawyer can realistically commit.\nClients can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to thousands per hour. For example, lawyers practicing in smaller towns and cities generally charge less, while those practicing in heavily populated, urban areas tend to be more expensive. Generally speaking, the more complicated the case and the more experienced the attorney, the higher the lawyer rate per hour.\nHourly Vs. Flat Fees\nThe most common forms of lawyer costs are divided into three categories: attorney hourly rate fees, flat rate fees, and contingency fees. With these fees, the client is charged for the attorney’s time only. \nHourly billing, the most common fee arrangement, means exactly what its name implies. Namely, the lawyer and the legal staff will charge a specific hourly rate for the work done during a client’s case.\nWith flat-flee billing, a client will pay a specified retainer amount for a particular type of case. No matter how long the case takes or what complications are involved, the fee doesn’t change. Examples of cases eligible for flat fee billing include uncontested divorces, bankruptcy filings, immigration, trademarks, patents, and wills.\nIn addition to these fees, other costs may be associated with a client’s legal representation. This includes the cost of filing papers with the court or sending correspondence to an opposing party. Sometimes, attorneys may also require money down as a retainer. \nFactors That Impact Lawyer Hourly Rates\nThe lawyer rate per hour will depend on multiple factors, which may include:\n\nThe reputation of the lawyer and/or firm lawyer prices\nThe location and size of the law firm\nThe billing method used by the attorney\nThe complexity of the case\nThe lawyer’s experience level\nTotal cases handled by the lawyer\nTravel costs\n\nHow to Calculate Your Hourly Rate\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22863\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-to-calculate-lawyer-hourly-rate.jpg\" alt=\"Effectively manage your lawyer hourly rates with legal payments software.

Time tracking \nLegal billing and time tracking software allow lawyers in your firm to track their billable time from any internet-enabled device using multiple timers. This simplifies the process of entering billable time—from any location.\n2. Auto reconciliation \nYour law firm can also increase billing efficiency by automating the billing process. Once you’ve sent an invoice to a client, an invoicing automation solution helps by  automatically sending email or texting invoice reminders at an interval that works best for your firm. This streamlines the process of tracking each invoice, sending out reminders manually, and collecting payment.\n3. Activity tracking \nAttorneys are notorious multitaskers who often jump from one task to another. Legal billing software offers activity trackers that automatically keep tabs on all billable and non-billable actions you’ve performed on any given day—whether you’ve logged a time entry for them or not.

During this process, the first question typically asked is, “what is the average lawyer hourly rate?” \nBelow, we’ll explain the key things you need to know about lawyer costs and billing practices.\nHow Much Should a Lawyer’s Hourly Rate Be?\n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22864\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-much-should-a-lawyers-hourly-rate-be.jpg\" alt=\"Effectively manage your hourly rates with case management software.

These rates vary depending on the practice area and geographic location. For instance, attorneys who are well-known in a certain area of the law may charge more hourly lawyer prices than those who aren’t. An attorney hourly rate may also differ based on what the case entails and how much time the lawyer can realistically commit.\nClients can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to thousands per hour. For example, lawyers practicing in smaller towns and cities generally charge less, while those practicing in heavily populated, urban areas tend to be more expensive. Generally speaking, the more complicated the case and the more experienced the attorney, the higher the lawyer rate per hour.\nHourly Vs. Flat Fees\nThe most common forms of lawyer costs are divided into three categories: attorney hourly rate fees, flat rate fees, and contingency fees. With these fees, the client is charged for the attorney’s time only. \nHourly billing, the most common fee arrangement, means exactly what its name implies. Namely, the lawyer and the legal staff will charge a specific hourly rate for the work done during a client’s case.\nWith flat-flee billing, a client will pay a specified retainer amount for a particular type of case. No matter how long the case takes or what complications are involved, the fee doesn’t change. Examples of cases eligible for flat fee billing include uncontested divorces, bankruptcy filings, immigration, trademarks, patents, and wills.\nIn addition to these fees, other costs may be associated with a client’s legal representation. This includes the cost of filing papers with the court or sending correspondence to an opposing party. Sometimes, attorneys may also require money down as a retainer. \nFactors That Impact Lawyer Hourly Rates\nThe lawyer rate per hour will depend on multiple factors, which may include:\n\nThe reputation of the lawyer and/or firm lawyer prices\nThe location and size of the law firm\nThe billing method used by the attorney\nThe complexity of the case\nThe lawyer’s experience level\nTotal cases handled by the lawyer\nTravel costs\n\nHow to Calculate Your Hourly Rate\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22863\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-to-calculate-lawyer-hourly-rate.jpg\" alt=\"Effectively manage your lawyer hourly rates with legal payments software.

Time tracking \nLegal billing and time tracking software allow lawyers in your firm to track their billable time from any internet-enabled device using multiple timers. This simplifies the process of entering billable time—from any location.\n2. Auto reconciliation \nYour law firm can also increase billing efficiency by automating the billing process. Once you’ve sent an invoice to a client, an invoicing automation solution helps by  automatically sending email or texting invoice reminders at an interval that works best for your firm. This streamlines the process of tracking each invoice, sending out reminders manually, and collecting payment.\n3. Activity tracking \nAttorneys are notorious multitaskers who often jump from one task to another. Legal billing software offers activity trackers that automatically keep tabs on all billable and non-billable actions you’ve performed on any given day—whether you’ve logged a time entry for them or not. This makes it easy to review and record time for hourly lawyer costs and billable activities that would otherwise slip through the cracks at the end of your day. \nInterested in increasing legal payment collection and exploring how MyCase can streamline your hourly billing process?

But behind every partner is a comprehensive legal professional team that keeps the wheels turning. That’s why hiring the right team members and managing them well is essential to success. \nIn this article, we’ll discuss how to build the right team for your law firm, including attorneys, paralegals, office managers, and more. We’ll also provide tips to help these team members reach their fullest potential for a more productive firm. \nBuild the Right Team \nWhen building a legal professional team, law firms often think primarily about job function. Do we need another associate? How many staff members should we employ per attorney? \nWhile those questions are important, choosing the right team members who work together efficiently and respectfully is just as necessary. In fact, a study of more than 130 teams found that a greater number of altruistic, curious, and cool-headed staff members leads to more effective work groups. \nSimilarly, research conducted by Hogan X, a personality assessment and leadership development company, concluded that team members’ personality traits largely determine psychological team roles (such as members who are results-oriented or relationship-focused). The combination and balance of these workgroup roles hugely affect a team’s likelihood of success or failure. Keep this in mind after narrowing down candidates by role: Who fits with the rest of the group? \nWho Should Be On Your Team? \nWhen it comes to job functions, there’s no one correct law firm structure. The right type and number of people for your firm depend on several factors. This includes your firm’s size, goals, practice area(s), virtual or in-office presence, and skill set needs. Most law firms have a customized combination of the following team members. \n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23213\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1144575927-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"An efficient legal professional team starts with legal practice management software.

There are several different types: equity, non-equity, and managing. \n\nEquity partners have an ownership stake in the firm and a share in the profits.\nNon-equity partners typically receive a salary and might have some voting rights in law firm issues. They usually become equity partners after several years of work and capital contribution in their current role. \nManaging partners are the most senior-level lawyers at law firms. A managing partner practices law while overseeing operations and guiding the firm’s strategic vision.\n\nNot all firms employ the entire hierarchy of lawyers. A small firm, for example, may have two equity partners who handle various firm management duties, three associates, and three support staff. \nAssociates \nAssociates are less experienced attorneys who are on the path toward partnership. An associate’s scope of practice typically depends on their legal experience and role within the firm. For instance, a more senior associate at a mid-sized firm may interface with clients, manage cases under partner supervision, and possibly develop business. \nThere is no one-size-fits-all ratio for partners and associates. Smaller law firms may reach maximum efficiency with one or two associates per equity partner, while large firms may prefer three or more per partner. \nParalegals and Legal Secretaries \nParalegals (often called legal assistants) can’t provide legal advice but help attorneys in a variety of capacities such as:\n\nConducting research\nGathering documents\nOrganizing information\nManaging client contacts\n\nAlthough they aren’t required to be certified (as of the date of this article’s publication), paralegals may be certified by an association, such as the National Association of Legal Assistants. \nLegal secretaries perform a similarly valuable role. They typically perform more clerical duties than paralegals, although sometimes paralegals handle both legal assistance and secretarial duties. A legal secretary may complete the following tasks. \n\nTracking deadlines\nCalendaring for attorneys and cases \nFiling and mailing paperwork \nHandling phone calls and messages \n\nLike the associate-to-partner ratio, there is no ideal legal support staff-to-lawyer ratio. Some law firms may employ one legal secretary per partner, while others share paralegals and secretaries across the firm. The best way to assess whether your law firm needs more assistance is to review how much time each attorney spends on non-billable tasks. \nIf you find that lawyers are spending too many hours preparing client invoices and collecting payments, you may want to shift these duties to legal support staff or leverage technology tools. MyCase’s intuitive billing and invoicing software automates invoice creation using time entries. This saves hours on administrative work. It also provides automated payment reminders and syncs to QuickBooks. \nOffice Managers \nOffice managers focus on day-to-day law firm operations. Their duties can include: \n\nManaging office leases \nOverseeing office utilities \nBuying equipment, such as desks, computers, software, and phones\nImplementing security procedures and processes\nDeveloping best practices for law firm management \n\nWhile every firm has some form of law office management, only some have an office manager. Small firms often spread office management responsibilities across lawyers, paralegals, and legal secretaries.\nOffice Support Staff \nLike most businesses, law firms also need office support. This includes human resources, information technology, accounting, and marketing. As law firms grow larger, they tend to build more of these specialized teams in-house. Solo and small teams often take a combined approach, assigning some duties to team members, outsourcing others, and using technology to automate essential administrative tasks. \nAccording to the American Bar Association 2020 Legal Technology Survey report, 66% of solo practitioners manage their own marketing efforts, while 33% of law firms with 10 to 49 lawyers have internal marketing staff. Additionally, 97% of large firms with more than 100 lawyers have an internal marketing team. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23214 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1045876492-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Law firm practice management software helps legal professional teams work more effectively.

These can be symptoms of a bigger problem: not delegating enough tasks. \nThis is usually a more prominent issue for solo practitioners and smaller law firms—where team members must wear multiple hats. It’s easy to fall into the trap of throwing more hours at a problem rather than stopping to assess whether you should be completing the task in the first place. If you and your team members are working as hard as possible but feel like you’re just treading water daily, start delegating.\n\nUse time-tracking software and your calendar to make a list of everything that you’ve completed in the past two weeks. If you don’t use time-tracking software, write down everything you accomplished at the end of every day. After a week, you should have a snapshot of how you typically spend your time.\nRemove any unnecessary tasks, such as driving to in-person meetings when you could save time by issuing virtual meetings or phone calls. \nOrganize the remaining tasks into four buckets based on complexity and importance: low complexity and low importance, low complexity and high importance, high complexity and low importance, and high complexity and high importance. \nDelegate tasks of low complexity and low importance across your legal professional team. \nTeach others how to do tasks of low complexity and high importance, and then delegate those duties. \nSimplify the processes for tasks of high complexity and low importance, and then delegate them. \nKeep tasks of high complexity and high importance on your plate. \n\nTip: Remember that MyCase streamlines complex processes and saves hours on administrative duties. With our legal workflow automation software, you can automate tasks, events, and deadline creation. Calendar a case or deadline with one mouse click for greater team efficiency. \nDefine Your Firm’s Goals\nYou’ll never reach the finish line if you don’t know where it is. Clear, defined goals enable your team to work together toward shared objectives. \nIdentify objectives for your legal professional team by setting realistic goals and outlining the steps for reaching those targets. For instance, let’s say that your criminal defense firm wants to convert more prospects into clients. You identify the client intake process as a pain point and set a goal to streamline the process from five days to two days. Break down that goal into smaller, achievable tasks, such as: \n\nTransitioning from a manual intake process to an automated one using customized client intake forms that sync directly to the client’s case file after they’re retained \nUrging your firm’s legal secretary to reach out to prospects within 30 minutes of receiving new consultation requests (MyCase’s client intake form system will send a notification whenever a new form is submitted) \nHelping associates prepare for every client consultation using our client interview transcript  \n\nNo matter your law firm structure, the key to success is the same: a group of lawyers working together effectively, supported by engaged staff members. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23215 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1311432411.jpg\" alt=\"A centralized calendar for your legal professional team prevents deadlines and appointments from falling through the cracks.

With MyCase legal calendaring software, your firm can ensure that all team members, from partners to paralegals, coordinate their availability. You never have to worry about a deadline or appointment falling through the cracks—staff can schedule events and reminders for attorneys, and all calendars update in real time (even across Google or Outlook calendars, after a simple, one-time integration). \nCentralized calendaring is so beneficial to law firm efficiency that MyCase customers scheduled more than 95,000 appointments per month in 2021, as shared in our Benchmark Report. \nInvest in Tools That Can Help Productivity \nWe make more than 200 decisions every day about food alone, according to researchers at Cornell University. Add to that the hundreds or even thousands of decisions made daily on client matters and law office management, and it’s easy to see why legal professionals often suffer from decision fatigue. \nA comprehensive client relationship management (CRM) system helps optimize and automate several everyday tasks, to avoid decision fatigue and increase productivity. The MyCase CRM can help your law firm accomplish the following and more.  \n\nCreate a robust client intake process that features customized intake forms, eSignature for quickly collecting client signatures, a virtual reception integration, and electronic invoicing capabilities to collect consultation and retainer fees more easily. \nTrack prospective clients throughout the sales lifecycle. You can manage leads as they advance by using built-in text messaging to stay in touch. This feature allows you to communicate without sharing personal phone numbers. You can also customize your pipeline to match your intake process. \nAnalyze law firm data, such as referral sources, to make informed decisions. \nIntegrate CRM data into your marketing efforts. Sync your MyCase lead database with Mailchimp for streamlined email campaigns.\n\nShow Your Team That You Value Them \nIf your team members are happy, they’re more likely to be productive and less likely to quit. This sentiment isn’t just common sense; it’s backed by research as well. Among actively disengaged workers, more than 70% said they were actively looking for a new job (compared to just 30% of engaged team members), according to a Gallup poll. \nIf you want an engaged and productive group of lawyers who consistently collaborate with support staff to build your firm, show them that you value their contributions. Try the following best practices for law firm management. \n\nProvide periodic reviews where you share both positive feedback and constructive criticism to help them grow in their role. \nDevelop a mentoring program to build stronger relationships across the firm. \nReward goal achievement with praise and tangible rewards. \nMake time for engagement activities like happy hours or team lunches. \n\nCreate a More Efficient and Profitable Firm \nWith the right law firm structure and law office management strategy, you’ll be on track to create a successful team that serves clients well. But you don’t have to do it alone—we’re with you every step of the way. \nMyCase legal practice management software can help you free up at least three billable hours per day and increase your caseload by 38% whether your a big law firm or a boutique law firm.

But behind every partner is a comprehensive legal professional team that keeps the wheels turning. That’s why hiring the right team members and managing them well is essential to success. \nIn this article, we’ll discuss how to build the right team for your law firm, including attorneys, paralegals, office managers, and more. We’ll also provide tips to help these team members reach their fullest potential for a more productive firm. \nBuild the Right Team \nWhen building a legal professional team, law firms often think primarily about job function. Do we need another associate? How many staff members should we employ per attorney? \nWhile those questions are important, choosing the right team members who work together efficiently and respectfully is just as necessary. In fact, a study of more than 130 teams found that a greater number of altruistic, curious, and cool-headed staff members leads to more effective work groups. \nSimilarly, research conducted by Hogan X, a personality assessment and leadership development company, concluded that team members’ personality traits largely determine psychological team roles (such as members who are results-oriented or relationship-focused). The combination and balance of these workgroup roles hugely affect a team’s likelihood of success or failure. Keep this in mind after narrowing down candidates by role: Who fits with the rest of the group? \nWho Should Be On Your Team? \nWhen it comes to job functions, there’s no one correct law firm structure. The right type and number of people for your firm depend on several factors. This includes your firm’s size, goals, practice area(s), virtual or in-office presence, and skill set needs. Most law firms have a customized combination of the following team members. \n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23213\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1144575927-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"An efficient legal professional team starts with legal practice management software.

There are several different types: equity, non-equity, and managing. \n\nEquity partners have an ownership stake in the firm and a share in the profits.\nNon-equity partners typically receive a salary and might have some voting rights in law firm issues. They usually become equity partners after several years of work and capital contribution in their current role. \nManaging partners are the most senior-level lawyers at law firms. A managing partner practices law while overseeing operations and guiding the firm’s strategic vision.\n\nNot all firms employ the entire hierarchy of lawyers. A small firm, for example, may have two equity partners who handle various firm management duties, three associates, and three support staff. \nAssociates \nAssociates are less experienced attorneys who are on the path toward partnership. An associate’s scope of practice typically depends on their legal experience and role within the firm. For instance, a more senior associate at a mid-sized firm may interface with clients, manage cases under partner supervision, and possibly develop business. \nThere is no one-size-fits-all ratio for partners and associates. Smaller law firms may reach maximum efficiency with one or two associates per equity partner, while large firms may prefer three or more per partner. \nParalegals and Legal Secretaries \nParalegals (often called legal assistants) can’t provide legal advice but help attorneys in a variety of capacities such as:\n\nConducting research\nGathering documents\nOrganizing information\nManaging client contacts\n\nAlthough they aren’t required to be certified (as of the date of this article’s publication), paralegals may be certified by an association, such as the National Association of Legal Assistants. \nLegal secretaries perform a similarly valuable role. They typically perform more clerical duties than paralegals, although sometimes paralegals handle both legal assistance and secretarial duties. A legal secretary may complete the following tasks. \n\nTracking deadlines\nCalendaring for attorneys and cases \nFiling and mailing paperwork \nHandling phone calls and messages \n\nLike the associate-to-partner ratio, there is no ideal legal support staff-to-lawyer ratio. Some law firms may employ one legal secretary per partner, while others share paralegals and secretaries across the firm. The best way to assess whether your law firm needs more assistance is to review how much time each attorney spends on non-billable tasks. \nIf you find that lawyers are spending too many hours preparing client invoices and collecting payments, you may want to shift these duties to legal support staff or leverage technology tools. MyCase’s intuitive billing and invoicing software automates invoice creation using time entries. This saves hours on administrative work. It also provides automated payment reminders and syncs to QuickBooks. \nOffice Managers \nOffice managers focus on day-to-day law firm operations. Their duties can include: \n\nManaging office leases \nOverseeing office utilities \nBuying equipment, such as desks, computers, software, and phones\nImplementing security procedures and processes\nDeveloping best practices for law firm management \n\nWhile every firm has some form of law office management, only some have an office manager. Small firms often spread office management responsibilities across lawyers, paralegals, and legal secretaries.\nOffice Support Staff \nLike most businesses, law firms also need office support. This includes human resources, information technology, accounting, and marketing. As law firms grow larger, they tend to build more of these specialized teams in-house. Solo and small teams often take a combined approach, assigning some duties to team members, outsourcing others, and using technology to automate essential administrative tasks. \nAccording to the American Bar Association 2020 Legal Technology Survey report, 66% of solo practitioners manage their own marketing efforts, while 33% of law firms with 10 to 49 lawyers have internal marketing staff. Additionally, 97% of large firms with more than 100 lawyers have an internal marketing team. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23214 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1045876492-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Law firm practice management software helps legal professional teams work more effectively.

Once you’ve created the right team, your law firm must help team members work efficiently for greater profitability. \nBelow are five best practices for law office management. These tips will help you engage your team and ensure that attorneys and support staff work as one firm.  \nImprove Task Delegation \nDo you ever end your day with more to-dos than when you started? Do you feel mentally drained from trying to multitask? These can be symptoms of a bigger problem: not delegating enough tasks. \nThis is usually a more prominent issue for solo practitioners and smaller law firms—where team members must wear multiple hats. It’s easy to fall into the trap of throwing more hours at a problem rather than stopping to assess whether you should be completing the task in the first place. If you and your team members are working as hard as possible but feel like you’re just treading water daily, start delegating.\n\nUse time-tracking software and your calendar to make a list of everything that you’ve completed in the past two weeks. If you don’t use time-tracking software, write down everything you accomplished at the end of every day. After a week, you should have a snapshot of how you typically spend your time.\nRemove any unnecessary tasks, such as driving to in-person meetings when you could save time by issuing virtual meetings or phone calls. \nOrganize the remaining tasks into four buckets based on complexity and importance: low complexity and low importance, low complexity and high importance, high complexity and low importance, and high complexity and high importance. \nDelegate tasks of low complexity and low importance across your legal professional team. \nTeach others how to do tasks of low complexity and high importance, and then delegate those duties. \nSimplify the processes for tasks of high complexity and low importance, and then delegate them. \nKeep tasks of high complexity and high importance on your plate. \n\nTip: Remember that MyCase streamlines complex processes and saves hours on administrative duties. With our legal workflow automation software, you can automate tasks, events, and deadline creation. Calendar a case or deadline with one mouse click for greater team efficiency. \nDefine Your Firm’s Goals\nYou’ll never reach the finish line if you don’t know where it is. Clear, defined goals enable your team to work together toward shared objectives. \nIdentify objectives for your legal professional team by setting realistic goals and outlining the steps for reaching those targets. For instance, let’s say that your criminal defense firm wants to convert more prospects into clients. You identify the client intake process as a pain point and set a goal to streamline the process from five days to two days. Break down that goal into smaller, achievable tasks, such as: \n\nTransitioning from a manual intake process to an automated one using customized client intake forms that sync directly to the client’s case file after they’re retained \nUrging your firm’s legal secretary to reach out to prospects within 30 minutes of receiving new consultation requests (MyCase’s client intake form system will send a notification whenever a new form is submitted) \nHelping associates prepare for every client consultation using our client interview transcript  \n\nNo matter your law firm structure, the key to success is the same: a group of lawyers working together effectively, supported by engaged staff members. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23215 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1311432411.jpg\" alt=\"A centralized calendar for your legal professional team prevents deadlines and appointments from falling through the cracks.

With MyCase legal calendaring software, your firm can ensure that all team members, from partners to paralegals, coordinate their availability. You never have to worry about a deadline or appointment falling through the cracks—staff can schedule events and reminders for attorneys, and all calendars update in real time (even across Google or Outlook calendars, after a simple, one-time integration). \nCentralized calendaring is so beneficial to law firm efficiency that MyCase customers scheduled more than 95,000 appointments per month in 2021, as shared in our Benchmark Report. \nInvest in Tools That Can Help Productivity \nWe make more than 200 decisions every day about food alone, according to researchers at Cornell University. Add to that the hundreds or even thousands of decisions made daily on client matters and law office management, and it’s easy to see why legal professionals often suffer from decision fatigue. \nA comprehensive client relationship management (CRM) system helps optimize and automate several everyday tasks, to avoid decision fatigue and increase productivity. The MyCase CRM can help your law firm accomplish the following and more.  \n\nCreate a robust client intake process that features customized intake forms, eSignature for quickly collecting client signatures, a virtual reception integration, and electronic invoicing capabilities to collect consultation and retainer fees more easily. \nTrack prospective clients throughout the sales lifecycle. You can manage leads as they advance by using built-in text messaging to stay in touch. This feature allows you to communicate without sharing personal phone numbers. You can also customize your pipeline to match your intake process. \nAnalyze law firm data, such as referral sources, to make informed decisions. \nIntegrate CRM data into your marketing efforts. Sync your MyCase lead database with Mailchimp for streamlined email campaigns.\n\nShow Your Team That You Value Them \nIf your team members are happy, they’re more likely to be productive and less likely to quit. This sentiment isn’t just common sense; it’s backed by research as well. Among actively disengaged workers, more than 70% said they were actively looking for a new job (compared to just 30% of engaged team members), according to a Gallup poll. \nIf you want an engaged and productive group of lawyers who consistently collaborate with support staff to build your firm, show them that you value their contributions. Try the following best practices for law firm management. \n\nProvide periodic reviews where you share both positive feedback and constructive criticism to help them grow in their role. \nDevelop a mentoring program to build stronger relationships across the firm. \nReward goal achievement with praise and tangible rewards. \nMake time for engagement activities like happy hours or team lunches. \n\nCreate a More Efficient and Profitable Firm \nWith the right law firm structure and law office management strategy, you’ll be on track to create a successful team that serves clients well. But you don’t have to do it alone—we’re with you every step of the way. \nMyCase legal practice management software can help you free up at least three billable hours per day and increase your caseload by 38% whether your a big law firm or a boutique law firm.

By following clear, step-by-step procedures, you can ensure accurate reporting and meet the January 31, 2025, deadline for filing 1099s. \nHow to File Form 1099-NEC \nForm 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation) is designed for reporting payments of $600 or more to independent contractors, freelancers, or other nonemployees. \nThe Form 1099-NEC filing procedure involves the following steps:\n\nIdentify reportable payments: Determine if you paid $600 or more to nonemployees during the calendar year. These payments are subject to Form 1099-NEC reporting.\n\n\nCollect recipient information: Use a downloadable W-9 Form to obtain the recipient’s legal name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n\n\nComplete the form: Fill out Form 1099-NEC with the recipient’s details, total amount paid, and your business information. Double-check for accuracy. \n\n\nDistribute copies: Provide a copy of Form 1099-NEC to the recipient by January 31 so they can report the income on their tax return. \n\n\nFile with the IRS and state: Upon form completion, submit Form 1099-NEC to the IRS and required state. The 1099 filing deadline for 2025 is January 31. \n\n\nReport corrections: If you discover incorrect information on a previously submitted 1099, report the correction to the IRS as soon as possible to avoid penalties.\n\nHow to File Form 1099-MISC \nForm 1099-MISC is used to report miscellaneous compensation over $600 that would not be classified as wages for employees or contractors. This includes payments such as rent, royalties, prizes, awards, and certain types of medical and healthcare payments. \nThe Form 1099-MISC filing procedure involves the following steps: \n\nIdentify reportable payments: Determine if you paid $600 or more during the year for items like rent, prizes, awards, or other miscellaneous income that qualify for reporting.\n\n\nCollect recipient information: Use Form W-9 to obtain the recipient’s legal name, address, and TIN.\n\n\nComplete the form: Fill out Form 1099-MISC with accurate details about the recipient, the payment amount, and your business information.\n\n\nDistribute copies: Provide a copy to the recipient. The deadline to send 1099s to recipients is January 31.\n\n\nFile with the IRS: Submit a copy to the IRS by February 28 if filing by paper or by March 31 if filing electronically. The IRS requires e-filing if your firm submits 10 or more information returns in a year.  \n\nWhat Are the Penalties for Not Filing 1099 Forms on Time?\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29162\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nFailure to meet the deadline for 1099s can result in financial and legal penalties as well as IRS scrutiny. Understanding key tips and common errors when filing a 1099 form can help avoid these issues and ensure compliance. Penalties for late or missing filings are based on the duration of the delay:\n\nWithin 30 days after the 1099 deadline: $60 per form; maximum penalty of $232,500 for small businesses.\nMore than 30 days late but before August 1: $130 per form; maximum penalty of $664,500 for small businesses.\nAfter August 1 or not filing at all: $330 per form; maximum penalty of $1,329,000 for small businesses.\nIntentional disregard: $660 per form; no cap on total penalty. \n\nHow Does MyCase 1099 Vendor Reporting Make it Easy to File 1099 Forms by Deadline?\nMyCase Accounting streamlines the entire 1099 process to help your law firm stay organized and compliant as the 1099 filing deadline for 2025 approaches.

By following clear, step-by-step procedures, you can ensure accurate reporting and meet the January 31, 2025, deadline for filing 1099s. \nHow to File Form 1099-NEC \nForm 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation) is designed for reporting payments of $600 or more to independent contractors, freelancers, or other nonemployees. \nThe Form 1099-NEC filing procedure involves the following steps:\n\nIdentify reportable payments: Determine if you paid $600 or more to nonemployees during the calendar year. These payments are subject to Form 1099-NEC reporting.\n\n\nCollect recipient information: Use a downloadable W-9 Form to obtain the recipient’s legal name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n\n\nComplete the form: Fill out Form 1099-NEC with the recipient’s details, total amount paid, and your business information. Double-check for accuracy. \n\n\nDistribute copies: Provide a copy of Form 1099-NEC to the recipient by January 31 so they can report the income on their tax return. \n\n\nFile with the IRS and state: Upon form completion, submit Form 1099-NEC to the IRS and required state. The 1099 filing deadline for 2025 is January 31. \n\n\nReport corrections: If you discover incorrect information on a previously submitted 1099, report the correction to the IRS as soon as possible to avoid penalties.\n\nHow to File Form 1099-MISC \nForm 1099-MISC is used to report miscellaneous compensation over $600 that would not be classified as wages for employees or contractors. This includes payments such as rent, royalties, prizes, awards, and certain types of medical and healthcare payments. \nThe Form 1099-MISC filing procedure involves the following steps: \n\nIdentify reportable payments: Determine if you paid $600 or more during the year for items like rent, prizes, awards, or other miscellaneous income that qualify for reporting.\n\n\nCollect recipient information: Use Form W-9 to obtain the recipient’s legal name, address, and TIN.\n\n\nComplete the form: Fill out Form 1099-MISC with accurate details about the recipient, the payment amount, and your business information.\n\n\nDistribute copies: Provide a copy to the recipient. The deadline to send 1099s to recipients is January 31.\n\n\nFile with the IRS: Submit a copy to the IRS by February 28 if filing by paper or by March 31 if filing electronically. The IRS requires e-filing if your firm submits 10 or more information returns in a year.  \n\nWhat Are the Penalties for Not Filing 1099 Forms on Time?\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29162\" src=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2.png 1176w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-300x36.png 300w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-1024x123.png 1024w, https://www.mycase.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MC-Blog-Preparing-Your-Law-Firm-1099-Deadline-_Pull-Quote-2-768x92.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px\" />\nFailure to meet the deadline for 1099s can result in financial and legal penalties as well as IRS scrutiny. Understanding key tips and common errors when filing a 1099 form can help avoid these issues and ensure compliance. Penalties for late or missing filings are based on the duration of the delay:\n\nWithin 30 days after the 1099 deadline: $60 per form; maximum penalty of $232,500 for small businesses.\nMore than 30 days late but before August 1: $130 per form; maximum penalty of $664,500 for small businesses.\nAfter August 1 or not filing at all: $330 per form; maximum penalty of $1,329,000 for small businesses.\nIntentional disregard: $660 per form; no cap on total penalty. \n\nHow Does MyCase 1099 Vendor Reporting Make it Easy to File 1099 Forms by Deadline?\nMyCase Accounting streamlines the entire 1099 process to help your law firm stay organized and compliant as the 1099 filing deadline for 2025 approaches.

How do they do it? In addition to extreme dedication and years of experience, they have the right tools and processes in place to provide their clients with responsive and reliable representation.\nWe recently spoke with Nicole DeBorde, Partner and Criminal Defense Attorney at Hochglaube & DeBorde, and Molly Bagshaw, Associate Attorney at the firm, to learn about their experience using MyCase and LawPay to build their firm into the thriving practice it is today.\nGetting Started with MyCase and LawPay\nBefore utilizing MyCase and LawPay to streamline their operations, Hochglaube & DeBorde used a combination of tools to store information and invoice clients. The process was timely and somewhat inconvenient for both clients and staff.\nNicole DeBorde explains, “We were using paper files, scanning and shredding materials. We were uploading them to a database. The clients didn’t have easy access to that database, but if they called us and requested it, we could bring them into the office and give them access. And for invoicing, clients needed to call the office to make a payment or to come in or send us a check.”\nIn an effort to provide a better client experience, reduce time spent on non-billable tasks, and create a simpler process for their team, the firm went in search of case management tools.\nAs DeBorde put it, “Lawyers are creatures of habit.” For many years, DeBorde ran her firm with the same tools and processes.\n“I was reluctant in the beginning to change anything that we were doing. But we researched MyCase and determined that the way that they store files, provide communication and billing options for clients, and so much more was beyond an organization system. And the client portal was much more efficient than what we were doing.”\nShe continues, “Once we made the decision to switch to MyCase, I thought it was going to take some time to learn. But the reality was, it was a breeze.” DeBorde explains that “It was very intuitive. We could upload materials to it quickly and easily.”\nDeBorde explained that “One of our initial concerns with going to a system like MyCase was the cost. We were worried about whether the cost would offer the value that we would need to make it make sense. I can say broadly that it's been an enormous financial benefit and that the benefits outweigh the costs.\nAfter finding success with MyCase, Hochglaube & DeBorde decided to adopt LawPay to create a simple invoice and payment process for their clients.\n\n“LawPay onboarding was also a breeze. It was as simple as the click of a button,” says DeBorde. “When you enter data for a client invoice, there’s an option to let them pay through LawPay. The instructions are easy to follow, not only for the client but for the lawyers and office staff too. It’s really very intuitive and easy to use.”\nUsing MyCase and LawPay together has helped Hochglaube & DeBorde create an elevated client experience. “Everything is integrated now—a client can upload materials, look at the information in their file, and make a payment at two o’clock on a Saturday morning if that’s when they are thinking about their case,” explains DeBorde. “It’s really just a wonderfully integrated system.”\nThe Benefits\n\nIncreased Efficiency Through Document Management and Time Tracking\n“MyCase and LawPay together have totally revolutionized the way we practice law.” - Molly Bagshaw\nRunning a law firm involves dealing with a great deal of paperwork and complex case documentation. DeBorde explained how difficult it can be to keep materials organized and accessible for staff and clients. Additionally, the challenges of tracking time as you wade through complicated materials, documents, emails, notes, etc can be cumbersome. It’s easy for time to get away from you and for billable time to go unlogged.\n“MyCase has enabled us to keep better track of the time that we’re using. We can learn whether we’re using that time efficiently, and we can access our data in a much more useful way,” DeBorde comments\nMolly Bagashaw, another attorney at the firm, further explained, “MyCase really has changed everything for us. There are so many features that we use on a daily basis that have revolutionized our practice, our client communication, and our efficiency.” She continues, “We are so efficient with being able to communicate with clients, track out time, and make sure that every single note, every single thought is accounted for and in the same place. It streamlines every single process that we have in our office, and it is just truly incredible.”\nBetter Team Collaboration and Organization\n\n“It’s just been a wonderful tool for organizational purposes.” - Nicole DeBorde\n“One significant thing we've noticed through MyCase is an improvement in our organization of materials,” says DeBorde. “We find it so much easier to access important data at a moment's notice when we need to answer a question either for ourselves or for a client.”\nDeBorde explains that their whole team using MyCase has made it “incredibly easy to collaborate,” ensuring that they are using their time effectively, not duplicating efforts, and allowing them to easily switch between tasks without comprising data or productivity.\nSimple and Easy Payments, Billing, and Invoicing\n“We make so much more in terms of being able to keep accurate track of billing on cases where we build and in terms of actually collecting the fees that we charge in our cases because of MyCase and because of LawPay.” - Nicole DeBorde\nHochglaube & DeBorde uses both MyCase and LawPay to tackle their billing and invoicing processes and ensure their team is paid for every billable minute captured. They utilize invoice generation to ensure accurate invoices, time-tracking timers to reclaim billable hours, online payments to provide their clients with payment flexibility, and automated payment reminders to ensure timely payments.\n\nUtilizing MyCase and LawPay functionality, Molly Bagshaw says, “Our clients are able to make their payments in a way that makes sense for them when it makes sense for them.”\nShe further explains, “A lot of times, with billing, you don't even know that something might be due because there are just so many things going on. Our clients are often under a lot of stress. So if they receive that invoice, the client or the family member can pay it at their leisure. It has really helped with making sure that everything is documented and that those payments are made in a timely manner.”\nProviding an Elevated Client Experience\n“MyCase has really been a reputational boost…” - Nicole DeBorde\nAs a criminal defense firm, Hochglaube & DeBorde understands the stress that comes with facing a criminal accusation. “We want our clients to feel that they can trust us. We work really hard to make sure that our clients know that we’re going to do the very best that we can for them, no matter what the circumstances are,” comments Bagshaw. She emphasized the importance of constant client communication and the desire to ensure clients are always up to date on cases.\n“We pride ourselves on being accessible. We pride ourselves in being able to help guide you through what is often scary and mysterious because it is new to you,” says DeBorde. “MyCase has really been a reputational boost because it ensures that we are delivering the type of client communication that is expected.”\nIn addition to providing better client communication through MyCase, the Hochglabue & DeBorde team use LawPay to provide simple and flexible payment options to their clients.\n\n“LawPay has definitely helped with the client experience,” says Bagshaw. “It is wonderful for clients to be able to make payments from wherever they are. To be able to log in and send them a message of all the different ways that they can make payment is extremely helpful to them.”\nCreating a Profitable Law Firm with the Right Tools\n\n“I tell literally every single lawyer that I meet that they have to get MyCase and LawPay for their firm. It is so worth it. I don't know what I would do without it as far as client communication, billing, timing, keeping everything organized, there's nothing else like it.” - Molly Bagshaw\nHochglaube & DeBorde continues to provide unparalleled legal services through an elevated client experience and efficient, streamlined processes with MyCase and LawPay.

Business expenses like payroll, office equipment, and legal practice management software can quickly add up.\nTaking advantage of lawyer tax deductions can help you manage your law firm’s expenses and cut costs by lowering your law firm’s tax payments. Although it may be tempting to speed through filings, you might leave money on the table in the rush to finish.\nThis guide will cover a few common attorney tax deductions that could help save your firm money.\nOur guide is for educational purposes only and is not an exhaustive list. Tax deduction eligibility is also dependent on your law firm’s business structure We recommend consulting an accounting or tax professional for advice on filing tax deductions and requirements for specific tax years.\n1. Advertising Expense Deductions\nLaw firms need to spend money on advertising and marketing like any other business.\nAdvertising is also a common lawyer tax deduction you can leverage to offset spending. Potential deductible expenses may include costs for printing flyers or types of law firm digital marketing, like running paid advertisements on Google and Facebook. However, we strongly recommend working with an accounting or tax professional to help you understand what expenses qualify as advertising.\n2. Retirement and Pension Plan Deductions\nBusinesses often support their employees' retirement accounts and pension plans to incentivize and reward top talent. Retirement plan contributions are another source of law firm tax deductions. A few popular plans include Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAs, 401(k) plans, and pension plans.\n\nSIMPLE IRAs let employers make contributions of 2% or 3% of employee compensation. They’re available for small businesses with 100 or less employees. Deductions depend on your business structure.\n401(k)s are more adaptable by allowing you to choose the percentage you want to match. As of the time of writing, deductions can’t exceed 25% of compensation accrued or paid to eligible participating employees during the year.\nSimplified Employee Pension Plans (SEP) are available to all businesses regardless of size. Only employers contribute to this plan. Employers' contributions are tax-deductible, and employees can omit them from their gross income.\n\n3. Mileage, Vehicle, and Local Travel Deductions\nMost of the action in popular legal dramas occurs in the courtroom, but real-life lawyering requires a fair bit of travel. This includes driving to meet a client, commuting to interview a witness, examining evidence, or taking a deposition.\nYou can deduct local commuting expenses based on mileage or itemize associated costs accumulated during these activities to reduce your law firm’s tax burden.\n\nThe standard mileage deduction is based only on miles driven for typical business commutes. The mileage rate for 2024 is 67 cents for every mile.\nDeducting based on actual expenses requires you to meticulously track spending and documentation for expenses like gas, tire rotations, and insurance.\n\nOverall, tax planning for lawyers requires an organized law firm accounting system and meticulous financial record-keeping regardless of which filing options you choose. In case of an IRS audit, you must have receipts for your mileage and related costs.\n4. Travel Deductions\nIn addition to deductions for your daily commutes, many other long-distance travel-related expenses are also eligible for tax deductions.\nThese include long-distance transportation costs, such as:\n\nAirplane, train, or bus tickets\nFares or fees for taxis, rideshare services, or buses\nCar rental fees\nTolls and parking\n\nYou can also deduct certain expenses accrued while traveling, like:\n\nMeals\nLuggage and shipping\nLodging\nLaundry services\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the IRS distinctions between deductions related to local transportation and more long-term travel.\nTo qualify for travel-related deduction, the IRS requires you to commute away from your tax home or place of business. You’re considered away from your tax home if you’re away longer than a normal day’s work and need rest to continue working.\n5. Educational Expense Deductions\nSuccessfully practicing law requires a sharp mind. A typical day can range from digging through the archives for an obscure case to trading verbal blows in court. To accomplish this, you must stay up-to-date on new legal developments and fulfill continuing education requirements to maintain your license.\nYou can potentially deduct educational expenses that you and your staff partake in. For example, you may cover a certain number of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) classes for employees as part of their benefits package.\nIf you’d still like to save money on training, LawPay offers a variety of free high-quality CLEs.\nWatch our CLE webinar on Current Trends in Attorneys Fees to learn more about modern trends in legal billing and finances like subscription models, flexible payments, and more.\n6. Business Supplies and Services\nThe cost of supplies like computers, software, and notepads can make up a large portion of deductions for any law firm’s taxes. Spending for outsourced services like HR and accounting are also potentially eligible.\nHowever, managing paper receipts and invoices throughout the year can quickly become an administrative nightmare. Converting to a fully paperless law office can eliminate physical file cabinets and help keep documentation organized come tax season.\n7. Home Office Expenses\nYou may be able to deduct tax expenses for the business use of your home if you have a dedicated area for practicing law. You can fully deduct direct business expenses, like maintenance and repairs to your office. You can also partially deduct indirect expenses like utilities.\nThere are two ways to deduct home office expenses:\n\nThe regular method allows you to fully deduct direct business expenses and partially deduct indirect expenses.\nThe simplified option allows you to calculate deductions based on the area of your home used for business. At the time of writing, this is calculated at a rate of $5 per square foot with a maximum of 300 square feet.\n\nMaintaining an accurate chart of accounts for your law firm is especially important when working from home. Accurate records can help keep business and personal expenses separate.\n8. Interest On Student Loans\nStudent loans are not tax-deductible, but you can potentially claim interest on student loans depending on how your business is structured. We recommend consulting a tax professional to determine if your business can use this deduction.\nFor loans to generally qualify for tax deductions, you must have taken out the student loan for you, your dependents, or your spouse. The loan doesn’t qualify if you are claimed by someone else as a dependent. These deductions are applicable for all student loans, including non-federal ones.\n9. Credit Card Fees\nLaw firms are increasingly using digital payments, like credit cards. Our 2024 Legal Industry Trends Report found that 78% of law firms accept online payments with credit and debit cards. Of those who accepted credit cards, 54% experienced an average monthly collection rate increase of at least $1,000.\nAccepting this payment method at your law firm can make it easier for clients to pay. However, credit card companies charge processing fees for handling transactions.\nSome businesses pass along transaction fees to customers, but these fees are potentially considered tax deductible if your firm pays them.\nTrack Your Business Expenses To Manage Your Taxes Properly\nMaximizing lawyer-specific tax deductions is much easier when you can see spending at a high level. LawPay’s legal spend management features help you track spending across your firm to see real-time insights, manage reimbursable expenses, and store receipts.\nJoin LawPay’s Smart Spend waitlist to give your team the tools to manage firm and client expenses once the feature is released.\n\nKeeping a clear paper trail is valuable for lawyer tax planning and even more valuable for managing your law firm’s expenses year-round.\nSchedule a demo to see how LawPay can simplify the financial side of running a legal practice.\nBack to blog",

It provides clients with flexible billing terms and increased access to legal services. Law firms benefit from these structured payment schedules by creating predictable streams of income and improving collection rates.\nLegal fees can be a major barrier for potential law firm clients. Limited budgets and the fear of high costs may be enough to discourage some from even asking for a consultation.\nSetting affordable (and profitable) prices can help you appeal to as many clients as possible. However, some clients may also need flexible payment options.\nLawyer payment plans are an efficient and reliable method of growing your client base while creating a steady cash flow for your firm. They're also in demand, with 56% of law firms setting up payment plans based on our 2024 Legal Industry Report.\nIn this guide, we'll discuss what lawyer payment plans are, the steps to implement them, and how this financial arrangement benefits both parties.\nWhat is a Lawyer Payment Plan?\nLawyer payment plans are financial agreements based on an outstanding balance clients pay over an extended period. These legally binding documents outline how much will be paid, when installments are due, and what happens when a payment is missed.\nLaw firms can choose to offer either a specific payment plan (for example, half now, half later) or tailor the plan to meet their client’s individual needs.\nPayment Plans vs. Legal Fee Financing\nLawyer payment plans are fee arrangements law firms manage, while third-party lenders manage legal fee financing.\nWhen implementing a payment plan, the client pays smaller, more manageable amounts toward their legal fees. Legal payment plans usually do not involve any outside financing, and the client is responsible for paying the entire amount—sometimes with interest.\nLegal fee financing, on the other hand, involves borrowing money from a third-party lender to pay for lawyer fees. In this arrangement, the law firm receives the full amount owed from the third-party lender.The client then repays the loan in smaller increments to the third-party lender over time.\nOverall, legal payment plans and legal fee financing have advantages and disadvantages. It’s important to understand the differences before choosing what to offer.\n\n\n\nPayment Plan\nLegal Fee Financing\n\n\n\n\nClients work with the law firm to pay invoices over time\nClients work with a third-party financing company to pay invoices over time\n\n\nLaw firms receive payment over time from the client\nLaw firm receives all of the payment upfront from the financing company\n\n\n\nPayment Plans\nAttorney payment plans can be a win-win for lawyers and clients. A few key benefits your firm can expect to see when using traditional payment plans include:\n\nAttracting more clients: Lawyers can make their services more accessible to clients who cannot afford to pay the full fee upfront.\nImproving cash flow: Legal payment plans can provide a steady income stream that allows the firm to more accurately budget and plan for future expenses.\nBuilding client loyalty: Lawyers can build trust and loyalty with their clients by offering flexible payment terms. Clients will likely appreciate a firm’s willingness to adjust, especially if competitors aren’t offering the same options.\nMinimize the risk of collections: Offering smaller, more manageable billing increments helps clients stay on track and reduces the need for collection efforts.\n\nWhile legal payment plans can offer benefits for lawyers, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider, including:\n\nRisk of non-payment: Lawyers may be left with unpaid fees if clients can’t or refuse to keep up with the payment plan. This can be especially problematic if the lawyer has already provided the services.\nAdministrative burden: Managing payment plans may require extra non-billable work, such as sending multiple invoices, tracking payments, and following up on missed payments. Law firms may need to hire additional staff to manage multiple complex payment plans.\nIncreased financial risk: Lawyers must rely on unpaid funds when managing budgets and cash flow. If too many clients default on their payments, the firm may fall behind on bills, salaries, or other financial obligations.\nPotential ethical concerns: Lawyers must ensure that their payment plans comply with all ethical rules and regulations, such as those related to fee splitting, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action or malpractice claims.\n\nLegal Fee Financing\nIn comparison, legal fee financing can be a good option for lawyers who want to reduce financial risk, attract more clients, and streamline administrative tasks.\nA few key benefits of legal fee financing include:\n\nGuaranteed payment: The lawyer receives the full fee upfront from the financing company, with no risk of non-payment. This can help the lawyer manage cash flow and avoid financial risk.\nProvide more payment options for clients: Clients can potentially have more flexible terms with a financing company compared to what law firms can reasonably offer.\nReduced administrative burden: Legal fee financing companies typically handle the clerical tasks associated with collecting payments.\nMarketing benefits: Some legal fee financing companies offer marketing and promotional support—helping lawyers attract more clients and grow their business.\n\nLegal fee funding can also include the following drawbacks:\n\nHigher costs: Legal fee financing typically involves interest rates and fees that can make it more expensive than other payment options.\nLimited options: Due to strict eligibility requirements, not all clients will qualify for legal fee financing. This ultimately protects the clients from overextending themselves financially but limits the lawyer's ability to offer financing as a payment option.\nCompliance risks: Lawyers must ensure that the financing company they work with complies with all ethical and legal rules and regulations.\n\nShould I Offer Payment Plans or Legal Fee Financing To My Clients?\nThe best payment arrangement for your law firm’s clients depends on their unique needs and preferences. The true client-centric solution is to offer both options so clients can choose what works best for them, so you can make services more accessible to a wider range of clients.\nWhy Should Lawyers Offer Payment Plans?\nLaw firms should offer payment plans since they can help them save time and improve cash flow while also improving client relations. Below are a few key reasons why this option can be beneficial.\nSpend Less Time Chasing Payments\nWhen time is money, chasing overdue payments can quickly become a costly expense that detracts from working on cases or expanding services. Payment plans allow you to schedule recurring payments at steady intervals. Revenue rolls in automatically, so you can focus on areas with greater impact.\nIncrease Collection Rate\nOur 2024 Legal Industry Trends Report found that 48% of law firms collected more money while using payment plans. Law firms that offer installment plans make it easier for clients to cover legal expenses over time, effectively improving the firm’s cash flow and increasing the firm’s ability to get paid.\nMake Your Services More Accessible\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, 55% of payment plan (also known as “Buy Now, Pay Later”) users choose this financing option since it’s the only way they can afford a purchase.\nBy offering a payment plan option at your firm, you'll open your legal services to a wider client base while relieving the financial burden of a total upfront payment for lawyer fees.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nPayment plans are an impactful way to empathize with your client’s needs. They provide flexibility to clients and their financial situations while nurturing a service-first focus that is prime for referrals. It can also help you stand out from competitors that don’t implement payment plans.\nHow To Offer Attorney Payment Plans at Your Firm\nOffering attorney payment plans requires advanced planning to nail down the logistics of your plan model. This includes terms, payment methods, and what tools you’ll use to manage each plan. Review the steps below to learn how you can implement them at your law firm.\n1. Develop a Payment Plan Model\nStrategic preparation will help your firm assess what you can offer and how to effectively communicate with clients.\nInitial questions might include:\n\nWhat frequency and duration of payment plans can you offer?\nWhat level of customization can you accommodate?\nHow do you plan to send timely invoices and payment reminders?\nWill you charge a retainer fee?\nWho keeps track of payments and client balances?\nHow will you handle disputes and payment errors?\nCan you offer discounts or incentives to pay the full amount upfront?\nCan you afford to offer legal fee financing?\n\nFinding these answers will help you build a template that outlines the payment plan model and conditions that best serve your business.\n2. Offer a Variety of Payment Types\nToday's modern clients require more payment options than ever to finance their legal needs. Lawyers can offer several forms of payment, including:\n\nPhysical or virtual credit or debit cards\nIn-person tap-to-pay transactions\nACH transfers like eChecks\nLegal fee financing through a third party\n\n3. Use a Legal Payment Software\nThe best legal payment software systems make payment plans easy to execute by doing the heavy lifting, which lets you get back to your practice. Features should include automated invoice generation and delivery, payment tracking, and reports that help check balances and provide financial planning insight.\nWith LawPay, firms can easily set up payment plans over a period of time, such as monthly or quarterly, to help clients manage the cost of legal services. Lawyers can also customize payments to fit the client's budget and billing schedule.\nWith LawPay's legal fee financing solution, powered by Affirm, your clients can pay for legal services in installments while your firm receives 100 percent of the invoiced amount upfront. If a client misses a payment, your firm is never responsible for collecting or paying back the funds to the third-party lender.\nLawPay’s other comprehensive billing features also give your law firm high-level insight into billing and invoicing. Quickly track payment activity, see the statuses of all accounts, and automate non-billable tasks like payment reminders to increase collection rate and decrease administrative work. Additional features like our secure Card Vault help further streamline the entire payment process.\n4. Build a System for Missed Payments\nLate payments are a reality that many law firms face, so it’s essential to know how to handle them before implementing a payment plan. Questions you’ll need to answer include:\n\nWill you offer a grace period? If so, for how many days?\nWill you accept partial payments?\nWill you charge interest or late fees for missed payments? How much?\nHow will you communicate the next steps for missed payments?\nHow often will you send payment reminders?\nWhen will your law firm stop services or take action due to missed payments? Will you plan to take legal action or work with a collection agency if payment is overdue for an extended period?\n\nCommunicating these answers to clients will set clear expectations that increase the likelihood of getting paid on time.\n5. Create an Agreement\nDuring the initial consultation with your client, transparency is key. Understanding their financial situation is important to determine their most appropriate payment plan. If they can only afford $200 monthly installments, anything more can lead to frustration and missed payments.\nIn addition to the amount, you’ll also want to discuss the following:\n\nPayment due dates (bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly)\nAccepted methods of payment (debit or credit card, checks, and/or ACH transfers)\nLate payment fees and terms (interest, penalties, and grace period)\nHow invoices will be sent (by mail or electronically)\n\nInclude any additional or customized billing terms in your written agreement. Then, once you and the client have agreed upon all conditions, you can request their signature on the attorney payment plan agreement.\nIf you decide to use legal fee financing through a third party, such as Affirm via LawPay, you won't need to worry about this step since the financing company will handle the agreement.\n*Download our eBook, \"The Billable Hour Reimagined,\" to learn how and why your law firm should tailor billing to your client’s needs.\nManage Your Law Firm's Payment Plans\nAccurate and up-to-date account management ensures that payment plans run smoothly.
